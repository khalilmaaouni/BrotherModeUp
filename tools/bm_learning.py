"""Pure functions for correction learning: normalization, hashing, atomicity,
scope rules, tokenizing and ranking.

WHY THIS FILE IS SEPARATE FROM bm_store.py
  bm_store.py is the ONLY writer of the database and its job is transactions.
  Everything here is a pure function: same input, same output, no connection, no
  clock, no filesystem. Keeping them apart means the interesting decisions (is
  this rule atomic? does this scope match? which rule ranks first?) can be tested
  exhaustively without a database, and the store stays readable as a store.

WHY THIS FILE IS SEPARATE FROM bm_learn.py
  bm_learn.py is the founder's command line. A CLI that also owns the semantics
  ends up with its rules only reachable by spawning a process.

RETRIEVAL MODE, STATED PLAINLY: this module implements DETERMINISTIC LEXICAL
matching, and that path is complete on its own. Since post-audit LOOP P7 there
is a SECOND, OPTIONAL mode: when the store carries a healthy SQLite FTS5 index
and the founder has opted in, bm_store.py hands this module a map of BM25
scores and ranking gains one extra named component. Everything here stays pure:
this file never opens a database, never probes for FTS5, and never decides
which mode is in force. It only knows how to rank with a BM25 map and how to
rank without one, which is why the fallback is the same code path rather than a
second implementation that drifts.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. No subprocess. Writes no files.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.

# Loop 6: duplicates, contradictions and supersession.
#
# WHAT THESE FUNCTIONS MAY AND MAY NOT CLAIM
#   Everything here is deterministic and lexical, the same honesty the retrieval
#   ranker holds itself to. There is no embedding, no similarity model, and no
#   attempt to understand what a rule means. So:
#     * a DUPLICATE is detected when two rules say nearly the same words in the
#       same scope, which is the case that actually floods a review queue;
#     * a CONTRADICTION is detected only when two rules in the same scope give
#       OPPOSITE polarity instructions about the same subject ("always push
#       through the desktop app" against "never push through the desktop app").
#       That is the shape a founder's own reversal takes, and it is the one
#       shape a lexical comparison can be trusted on. It is judged on how much
#       of the SHORTER action the longer one also names, so padding one side
#       with an ordinary founder clause does not hide the reversal, and the
#       trigger wording does not have to match for it to count.
#   "Use tabs" against "use spaces" is a real contradiction and this code will
#   NOT find it. That gap is why `link a contradicts b` exists as a founder
#   command: the founder can always declare a conflict the detector cannot see,
#   and a declared conflict counts exactly as much as a detected one everywhere
#   downstream. Nothing here ever RESOLVES a conflict; resolution is a founder
#   act, and these functions only ever describe.

# Loop 8: grading a correction that came back.
#
# The whole program's claim is that BrotherMode learns. The only way to tell
# learning from storage growth is to look at what happened AFTER a rule
# existed: work redone, a defect that reached the founder, or the same
# correction said twice. Those three are external evidence. The session being
# graded cannot write any of them about itself in a way that flatters it,
# because each one is anchored to a work record, an artifact, or the founder's
# own words.
#
# These functions decide, and nothing else here does. No clock, no database,
# no file, so the judgement is testable on its own and cannot drift with when
# it ran.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What each miss class says about the RULE itself, and therefore which way the
# evidence points.
#
# NOTHING here is 'support', and that is a correction of an earlier reading of
# this table. A rule that was followed and the correction came back anyway is
# evidence AGAINST the rule, and so is one retrieved into work it was then
# judged irrelevant to. Every other class (never retrieved, retrieved and
# skipped, nothing decidable) says something about the machinery around the
# rule and NOTHING about whether the rule works, so it is neutral.
#
# Why this matters far beyond a label: the promotion gate in
# bm_store.change_learning_rule_state lets a rule reach 'confirmed' on one
# supporting evidence row that is not the founder's own approval, and its
# stated meaning is "an independent event showing the rule worked". Calling a
# compliance failure 'support' handed that gate a row saying the rule was
# shown and skipped, so a rule could be promoted on proof it was never once
# followed. The founder re-stating a preference IS support for the rule, and
# that row is written where it belongs, by merge_learning_candidate, off his
# own words rather than off a loop failure.
