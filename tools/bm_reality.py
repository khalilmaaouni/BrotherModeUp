"""The verified-reality record: the smallest honest account of what
actually happened to a release after it shipped.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  docs/NORTH-STAR-CHAIN.md's own chain ends in a stage named
  verified-reality, and until this tool existed nothing in this project
  ever wrote a row for it. Every earlier stage (passport, evidence-
  integrity, release-readiness) is about what BrotherMode believed BEFORE
  a release went out; this one is about what happened in the world AFTER
  it did, and nothing before this tool recorded that at all. A release
  could be accepted, reopened, rolled back, or blow up in production, and
  the chain had no place to say so. Once a release ships, BrotherMode was
  blind.

  H4, the second half of the same gap: a defect discovered in production
  is a fact about the past unless it also creates a fact about the
  future. Without a forced return edge, "we found a bug" is a sentence
  someone types in a chat and the loop never closes. `defect` is that
  return edge: it cannot be written without also appending a new item to
  docs/plan/QUEUE.json, so a defect ALWAYS creates new queued intent, and
  the reality row and the queue item point at each other by id, so either
  one can be found from the other. Verb order matters here: the queue
  item is written FIRST and the reality row SECOND, deliberately, so a
  queue write that fails (an unwritable path, a malformed existing file)
  never leaves behind a reality row that claims to have created intent it
  did not.

THE FOUR VERBS
  accept  a human accepted a release. The one verb that can start a
          release's own history; every other verb must point back at one.
  enter   something happened to an already-accepted release: it was
          reopened, rolled back, or hit an incident. Always names the
          accepted record it happened to.
  defect  an incident with a name: writes the queue item AND the reality
          row, in that order, so the return edge is never partial.
  show    pure read. Prints one release's whole recorded history, or
          every release's history when no --release is given.

INSERT ONLY, ALWAYS
  Every write here appends exactly one row to tools/bm_store.py's
  reality_records table (schema 21) and nothing here ever asks that store
  to update or delete one: a record of what actually happened must not be
  quietly rewritten by a later, more flattering judgement. See
  tools/bm_store.py's own _REALITY_DDL comment and
  Store.add_reality_record's docstring for the three refusals this tool's
  writes run into on purpose (an anonymous acceptance, a record that
  links back to nothing, a defect that creates no intent).

EFFECT CLASSES (tools/bm_effects.py REGISTRY)
  accept, enter, defect are ledger_write: each mutates the BrotherMode
  store, and `defect` additionally regenerates docs/plan/QUEUE.json (a
  project_write in its own right, folded into `defect`'s ledger_write
  declaration the same way bm_project.py's composite commands are).
  show is pure_read: it opens ONLY a read-only store handle and writes
  nothing, including under --help, proven by tools/test_bm_effects.py's
  own purity suite running it in a sandbox.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network, no subprocess.

# `defect` write is not advisory, so acquire() here instead RAISES, naming
