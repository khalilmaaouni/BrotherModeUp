"""tools/bm_statusline.py: an opt in Claude Code status line for BrotherMode.

Design: docs/program/absolute-lead/DESIGN-visual-surface.md section 14,
item 1 (the founder's 2026-08-05 "answer 7"). Contract verified against:
docs/program/absolute-lead/research/visual-surface/LENS-D-claude-surface.md
section 6, and against the real code of tools/bm_view.py and
tools/bm_lead.py (see the note below on why this does not call bm-view).
The one paste settings block a founder needs is docs/STATUS-LINE.md; this
file is not installed by anything in BrotherMode, on purpose.

WHAT THIS IS
  A status line SCRIPT in the exact sense the Claude Code contract means
  the word: a program that reads one JSON object on stdin and prints at
  most one line on stdout. BrotherMode SHIPS this file. Nothing in
  BrotherMode installs it: plugin settings.json supports only the `agent`
  and `subagentStatusLine` keys, never `statusLine`, and the separate
  `footerLinksRegexes` setting is read only from the founder's own user
  settings, never from a plugin (LENS-D section 6, and confirmed directly
  against https://www.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json while
  writing docs/STATUS-LINE.md). The founder pastes one settings block into
  his own Claude Code settings himself.

WHAT IT SHOWS
  One line, plain language, built from two of the same eight fields the
  founder's own status view already uses: tools/bm_lead.py's
  collect_status returns Goal, Direction, Progress, Time remaining,
  Decision needed, Risk, Evidence and Next step, and this prints Progress
  next to whether a Decision needed stands. For example: "2 of 5 tasks
  accepted, decision waiting". No jargon, no store ids, no colour codes.

WHY THIS DOES NOT CALL `bm-view render`
  The design names `bm-view render --json` as the intended source. Read
  against the code rather than the design's expectation: cmd_render's
  --json branch (tools/bm_view.py, _render_once) prints
  {path, rel_path, fingerprint, changed, artifact_url}, never a status
  payload, and on every call it WRITES PROJECT-VIEW.html to disk and
  records a view row in the store. A status line that ran that on every
  keystroke would break this file's own first law below on every single
  invocation, and it would still have no status fields to show. So this
  file calls the cheapest read only accessor that actually carries the
  eight fields instead: tools/bm_lead.py's collect_status, against a
  bs.ReadOnlyStore. That is the exact same collector tools/bm_view.py's
  own header section and tools/bm_lead.py's own `status` subcommand
  already read from; no second collector is defined here.

FAIL SILENT IS LAW
  A status line runs on nearly every turn of a session (event driven,
  debounced at 300ms per the Claude Code contract). On ANY error at all:
  no BrotherMode project here, no store yet, setup not consented, a
  corrupt config, a malformed stdin payload, a missing field, more than
  one project in this folder, an exception of any kind, this prints
  NOTHING, to stdout or stderr, and exits 0. A status line that prints a
  traceback into the founder's terminal bar is a worse failure than a
  status line that stays blank. This file writes no file, ever: it never
  constructs a writable Store, only bs.ReadOnlyStore, and it calls no
  function that records anything.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. No subprocess.
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.

Usage (this is what Claude Code itself runs, per docs/STATUS-LINE.md):
  python3 tools/bm_statusline.py < payload.json
  bm-statusline < payload.json   # the packaged console script
