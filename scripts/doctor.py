"""doctor.py: ten named checks, each PASS, FAIL, or SKIP, plain remediation.

WHY THIS EXISTS (grew under Loop 3 design D-3, docs/superpowers/specs/
2026-08-01-loop3-consent-install-design.md)
  This file started as one question: is the fence hook wired AND live, or
  only wired? That question still matters most and its check is check 1,
  unchanged. The external review's section 13.5 asked for a wider surface:
  a founder running one command should learn whether the whole install is
  healthy, not only the fence. So doctor grew to ten checks: the fence
  simulation; version identity between VERSION and the plugin manifest;
  python3 and git availability; consent (has scripts/setup.py been run);
  the vault path; plugin-vs-clone duplicate hook detection (the recon's
  confirmed double-fire bug: both wirings present means every hook fires
  twice); project store health; hook wiring matching the consented
  installation_mode; a CHECKSUMS.sha256 self-check (catches a half-finished
  update); and whether settings.json itself is valid JSON.

WHAT EVERY CHECK PROMISES
  PASS, FAIL with one plain-word remediation a non-engineer can follow, or
  SKIP with the reason nothing could be checked. A check never crashes this
  program: an unexpected exception inside one check is caught and reported
  as that check's own FAIL, naming the exception, so one broken check cannot
  hide the other nine. Exit 0 only when every check is PASS or SKIP; --json
  prints the same information as one machine-readable object. BROTHERME_CONFIG
  and HOME are honored throughout (mostly by reusing scripts/setup.py's own
  config reader), so a test harness can point every check at a throwaway
  HOME without touching the real one.

CHECK 1: THE FENCE HOOK, KEPT EXACTLY AS BEFORE
  1. Reads settings.json and finds the PreToolUse group whose command names a
     bm_fence_hook.py. Missing group, missing entry, or a command pointing at
     a file that is not there are each reported as a PROBLEM, by name.
  2. Runs a BLOCKED-WRITE SIMULATION against the command string settings.json
     actually holds, not against a path this script reconstructs. It builds a
     throwaway project under a temporary directory, gives it its own store,
     claims one file under one session's label, then asks the wired hook to
     approve a write to that file from a DIFFERENT session. A healthy fence
     denies. Then it asks again as the owner, and a healthy fence allows,
     with output AND exit code both clean. Both halves are required: a hook
     that denied everything would pass the first check and is not a fence, it
     is a brick, and a hook that bricks by exiting 2 rather than by printing
     deny is the same brick. Every supported write tool is simulated in its
     own real input shape, so a fence that gates one of them and not the
     other three cannot report itself healthy.
  3. Says out loud that the fence FAILS OPEN, and what that means for the
     answer above.

  The simulation is harmless in the strict sense: every file it creates lives
  under a fresh mkdtemp directory that is removed at the end, it never touches
  your project, your store, or your STATE.md, and the write it simulates is
  never performed by anything. Nothing outside the temporary directory is
  read for the simulation except the hook and store code being tested.

WHAT NO CHECK HERE CAN TELL YOU
  That Claude Code has loaded the settings file you just fixed. A hook is
  read by the client at session start; a correct settings.json edited
  mid-session is not live until the next session. Doctor checks the file and
  the code, which is everything except the client's memory.

Python 3.9, standard library only. Runs subprocesses only to execute the
wired fence hook command, this project's own store CLI (check 7), local git
(check install_identity), and the stranded_install check, whose second half
(git ls-remote against the public origin) is the one network call this file
makes; offline or unreachable, that check reports NO-DATA rather than a
silent PASS.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.
