"""tools/bm_controller.py: U2, the durable Full-Auto controller ENGINE
(design docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-l03-controller-design.md; store
schema 15, tools/bm_store.py section "U2: the durable Full-Auto
controller").

WHAT THIS IS
  The resumable, nineteen-step loop (design section 3) that sequences a
  controller run from an outcome to a checked deliverable: ORIENTING ->
  PLANNING -> READY -> EXECUTING -> VERIFYING -> CHECKPOINTED -> ...  ->
  DELIVERABLE_READY, holding NO state in memory across a crash. Every
  forward move is committed to tools/bm_store.py's schema-15 tables
  BEFORE the externally visible effect it authorises (the durability
  contract, design section 1), so a fresh ControllerEngine constructed
  against the same store reconstructs exactly where the prior one was and
  resumes without repeating completed work.

  This file issues NO SQL of its own (the same house law bm_autonomy.py
  states for itself): every persistence call goes through one of the
  seventeen Store methods tools/bm_store.py's U2 section defines
  (open_run, set_run_state, upsert_units, select_ready_units, claim_unit,
  release_claimed_unit, record_dispatch, record_result,
  record_verification, mark_unit_done, mark_unit_failed, block_lane_units,
  unblock_lane_units, get_run, list_units, get_dispatch,
  list_dispatches) or a store primitive U2 REUSES verbatim
  from U1 (gate_check, spend_totals, latest_contract, record_spend,
  record_checkpoint, record_interruption, queue_human_step,
  list_human_steps, claim, transition). A structural guard,
  TestNoSQLGuard in tools/test_bm_controller.py, copied from
  tools/bm_autonomy.py's own (itself copied from tools/bm_project.py's),
  parses this file with ast and fails the build if a SQL-shaped string
  literal or a sqlite3 import ever appears here.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
  Not a process that spawns real subagents and blocks on them. The
  controller is a HARNESS the orchestrating model drives, not an
  independent worker pool (design's own load-bearing honesty statement,
  section 0). "Dispatch" means record-intent-and-await: the production
  WorkerAdapter (RecordIntentWorker below) writes a unit's brief to
  stdout for the orchestrating model to pick up and returns control
  immediately; the run parks in EXECUTING until a result arrives through
  receive_result(), which Writer B's `bm-controller record-result`
  command calls. This file never calls a model and never spawns one.

THE HARNESS SEAM (design section 4)
  Two boundaries are inherently impure: the worker's cognition (whether
  the model made the right change) and the subprocess that runs a
  done-check, a verifier, or a rollback command. BOTH are isolated behind
  a single, narrow, injected interface each (WorkerAdapter, CheckRunner),
  so ControllerEngine itself is deterministic and fully testable with a
  FakeWorker and a FakeCheckRunner (tools/test_bm_controller.py), no live
  model and no network. SubprocessCheckRunner below is the ONLY place in
  this file that touches `subprocess`.

AT-MOST-ONCE, HONESTLY (design section 5's own honesty note, restated)
  SQLite writes are transactional and idempotent by the store's own
  UNIQUE keys (controller_dispatches.UNIQUE(unit_id, attempt) is the
  exactly-once spine), so the RECORDING of an accepted result is
  exactly-once. A real worker's real file edit or real git commit is NOT
  something this file can make exactly-once; what this engine provides
  is at-most-once RE-DISPATCH (the dispatch UNIQUE key plus the held
  fence), idempotent recording, and a post-crash re-verification through
  the SAME independent done-check rather than trusting that a prior side
  effect happened. docs/FULL-AUTO.md (Writer B) states this limit for
  the founder.

USER-FACING STRINGS NAME NO REPO-RELATIVE PATH
  The one string this file writes (the unit brief RecordIntentWorker
  prints to stdout) carries only structural fields already stored on the
  unit's own definition; nothing here composes a path relative to this
  repository's checkout location.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. The only `subprocess` call
site is SubprocessCheckRunner.run, and it exists to run the founder's OWN
done_check/verifier/rollback commands, never anything this file invents.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.

#: (CROSS-FAMILY REFUTATION finding 3, HIGH, DATA DESTRUCTION).
#:
#: git honours GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE OVER cwd, so a shipped
#: `bm-controller record-result` invoked in an environment where those are
#: set (a git hook, a wrapper script, another repository's tooling) ran the
#: unit's rollback against a DIFFERENT repository and exited 0, which this
#: engine reads as a clean rollback and therefore warns nobody about. The
#: orchestrator reproduced it first hand: two throwaway repositories P and
#: Q, an uncommitted edit in Q, `GIT_DIR=../Q/.git GIT_WORK_TREE=../Q git
#: restore -- a.py` run from inside P, and Q's edit was destroyed.
#:
#: A PREFIX rather than a list, and that is the whole point. The names were
#: enumerated on this machine (git 2.50.1) as the union of three sources
#: rather than from memory: the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section of git(1),
#: the environment section of git-config(1), and `strings` over the shipped
#: git binary. That union is 205 distinct GIT_ names, and the ones that
#: really move where git operates are NOT all in the documentation:
#: GIT_CONFIG, GIT_CONFIG_COUNT, GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS, GIT_ATTR_GLOBAL,
#: GIT_ATTR_SYSTEM, GIT_GRAFT_FILE, GIT_SHALLOW_FILE, GIT_QUARANTINE_PATH,
#: GIT_IMPLICIT_WORK_TREE, GIT_EXEC_PATH, GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR,
#: GIT_REPLACE_REF_BASE and GIT_PREFIX all appear in git(1)'s own
#: environment section NOWHERE. A hand-kept list would have shipped with
#: those thirteen holes in it and would have grown a fourteenth the next
#: time git added one. The prefix covers every name git reads today and
#: every name it adds later, at the cost of the small, disclosed set below.
#:
#: WHAT THIS COSTS, stated rather than buried: a command that RELIED on an
#: inherited GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_SSH_COMMAND or GIT_PAGER now sees git's
#: own configured defaults instead. That is the correct direction for this

#: THE EXECUTION LEDGER, and the three clauses every founder-facing
#: "nothing ran" sentence in this file is built from (REFUTATION-6 F2).
#:
#: Round 6 fixed one such sentence by giving one branch its own constant,
#: and the defect came straight back in the constant this round INTRODUCED:
#: `_NOTE_SPEND_BREAKER` hard-codes "NO command was run for this result:
#: not the unit's done_check, not its verifier, not the rollback and not
#: the whole done-definition", and two of its three use sites are reached
#: in calls that just ran a done_check, a verifier and a `git restore`.
#: docs/FULL-AUTO.md promises the opposite in as many words.
#:
#: A per-branch constant cannot fix that class, because the branch is
#: exactly the wrong thing to derive the sentence from: it says which test
#: refused, not what already executed. So the sentence is derived from the
#: LEDGER ControllerEngine._run_command writes, which is the one funnel
#: every command in this module passes through. A site that runs a command
#: without naming itself to the ledger is a test failure
#: (test_every_command_site_names_itself_to_the_ledger).
#:
#: SCOPE OF THE WORD "this call": the ledger is reset at every PUBLIC entry
#: point, so on `bm-controller record-result`, which handles exactly one
#: result, "this call" and "this result" are the same set. On a `step` or
#: `check_timeouts` wave that judges several units it is the whole wave,
#: which is coarser and still true. docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md states that.

        judged, that is, when subtracting it puts both meters back under
        their ceilings.

        This is the one carve-out in _authorisation_refusal, and it is a
        computation rather than a switch, which matters: `charged` is never
        a caller's opinion, it is what Store.record_spend DURABLY WROTE a
        few statements earlier for this unit's own already-authorised work
        (see _record_spend's return value). Nobody can pass a number to
        loosen the gate without the meter carrying that same number.

        Why it is right rather than convenient: the founder's ceiling is a
        limit on what may be SPENT, and this money is already spent. The
        unit was dispatched under a verdict that was ALLOWED, it did the
        work, and its answer is in hand. Refusing to read that answer
        destroys it and burns a retry without saving a single token, and
        the spend row is what stops the run anyway: step()'s own step-3
        breaker gate drains the whole run on the very next call, and
        _deliver_or_hold will not declare a deliverable. So exactly ONE
        already-paid unit is judged past the ceiling, its cost is on the
        meter where a founder can see it, and no NEW work starts.

        The refuted sequence is unaffected, which is the point: in
        REFUTATION-5 S2 the ceiling was blown by a separate
        `bm-autonomy spend` BEFORE `bm-controller record-result` was run,
        and the record-result supplied no cost at all, so there is nothing
        to subtract and the refusal stands.

        Round-6 disclosure, stated rather than hidden: a caller that
        self-reports an enormous cost therefore buys the judgement of the
        one unit already in flight. It buys nothing else, and it pays the

        one `bm-controller record-result` still ran the unit's

        the most expensive command in the system was the one it left
        ungated.

                   whichever direction it writes in.

        CLASS and FLOOR are deliberately NOT re-asked without a unit: they
        are per-unit questions, already asked and answered at dispatch, and
        the founder's own done_definition is not a model action bounded by
        the risk classes the founder granted the model. Asking them of the
        done_definition would refuse delivery on contracts that are

        row's liveness.

        (`bm-autonomy stop`, or `revoke`), one `bm-controller record-result`
        still executed the unit's own done_check AND a `git restore`
        rollback in the project root, and one plain `bm-controller step`
        did the same through the RESULT_IN resume branch, which by design
        runs BEFORE the live-contract read. In full auto the unit graph,
        including done_check and verifier, is MODEL-authored, so those two
        commands are the most consequential thing the kill switch has to
        stop, and `git restore` mutates the founder's working tree. Round
        4's section 10.6 is what added the rollback to that branch.

        `unit` is the unit row this command belongs to, when there is one,
        so the SCOPE half of the verdict is asked as well. Only the
        founder's own done_definition passes None, and only because it
        belongs to no unit.

        Returns the CheckOutcome, or None meaning NOTHING RAN. Every
        caller must treat None as "no command was executed" and must not
        invent an exit code for it: an unrun check has no verdict. That
        rule is UNCHANGED by the wider gate; what changed is how many
        reasons there now are for None.

        The gate is deliberately here, at the call site, rather than only
        at the branch points that route into it, so a command site added
        later is gated by construction. The structural half of the same
        property is tools/test_bm_controller.py's
        test_every_checker_call_sits_behind_one_gated_call_site and, since
        round 6, _execution_primitive_offences beside it, which asserts
        that no subprocess primitive is called anywhere in this module
        outside SubprocessCheckRunner.run and that `self.checker` is bound
        once and called once (REFUTATION-5 S5: the round-5 guard passed
        with `subprocess.run`, `os.system`, `getattr(self.checker, "run")`
        and an aliased `runner = self.checker` added inline).

        `label` is what this command is CALLED in the sentence a founder
        reads, and it is required of every call site by
        test_every_command_site_names_itself_to_the_ledger
        (REFUTATION-6 F2). It is appended to the ledger only AFTER the
        runner returns, so the ledger holds what really executed rather
        than what was about to be attempted; a runner that raises records
        nothing, which is the conservative direction (a sentence that
        under-claims what ran is corrected by the founder's own eyes on
        the tree, one that over-claims is not)."""

        was accepted under a killed contract, its fence released as sound
        work, its dispatch recorded 'pass', and ZERO founder steps named
        any of it. The founder's own done-definition had the same window in

        upsert_units does not know about applied BEFORE anything is
        written. Returns a new list of shallow-copied unit dicts; the
        caller's own dicts are never mutated.

        ONE, the unit_id must be a legal FENCE name once this engine's own
        UNIT_FENCE_PREFIX is on the front (REFUTATION-4 AZ F6). upsert_units
        validates a unit_id only as "a non-empty string"; Store.claim runs
        valid_name, which raises ValueError for whitespace, for the eight
        reserved characters, for a leading dot and for anything over 60
        characters. That raise happened AFTER step() had walked the run to
        EXECUTING, and _authorise_dispatch catches only OwnershipRefused,
        so every later `step` exited 1 and `plan`, the documented recovery,
        is refused from EXECUTING: a permanent wedge from `unit_id:
        "api/pay"`, which is exactly the naming a planner produces for a
        unit that owns a directory. Refusing HERE, before the ORIENTING
        walk and before upsert_units, is the version of the fix that leaves
        no wedge to recover from: nothing is written and the run has not
        moved.

        TWO, read_scope is canonicalised and refused on escape exactly as
        write_scope is (REFUTATION-4 AZ F9). upsert_units canonicalises
        every write_scope entry and stores read_scope with a bare
        json.dumps, and _build_brief hands it to the worker unchanged, so a
        brief could hand a worker '/etc', '../../../Users' and
        '~/.ssh/id_rsa' as its read scope while the identical entry in
        write_scope was refused 'path-escape'. In full auto the read scope
        is model-authored. The same two store primitives the store's own
        write_scope path uses are used here, so the two scopes cannot
        drift apart in what they accept.

        THREE, both scopes must be a LIST of paths, and every write_scope
        entry must be a plain relative path (REFUTATION-5 S1, S4 and S6).
        A scope emitted as a bare JSON string was iterated CHARACTER BY
        CHARACTER, so `"a.py"` became `['a', '.', 'p', 'y']`, '.' is the
        project ROOT, and the brief handed the worker the whole project
        while the unit's fence held it; a scalar was not iterable at all
        and left an uncaught TypeError out of the shipped `plan`; and an
        entry that is a git PATHSPEC (`:/`, `:!x`, `:(exclude)x`) survived
        every check round 5 had and turned the engine's own rollback into
        a `git restore` over the founder's whole working tree.

        REFUSING HERE, BEFORE THE ORIENTING WALK, IS THE POINT. The store
        refuses all three too (that is the declaration side, and it is the
        store writer's), but it refuses INSIDE upsert_units, which this
        method's own AZ F6 paragraph above explains is one state walk too
        late: the run is left in PLANNING with nothing planned. Refused
        here, nothing is written and the run has not moved, so `plan`
        again is a real recovery rather than a wedge.

        read_scope is still deliberately NOT gate-checked against
        allowed_paths; see _gate_check_write_scope's docstring for why that
        remains right. Canonicalising it and keeping it inside the project
        root is a different question, and it was not being asked."""

        guard the shape (Store.record_result's own 'already-resulted'
        refusal on a duplicate), walk the run's own state exactly as the

        situation, not a state-machine accident (a founder ran

        below rather than by attempting a move the store must refuse
        (R-L03-refutation-2 F1).

        THREE outcome words, not two: a unit_id on acceptance, "rejected",
        and "held" for a result that arrives while the founder has the run
        PAUSED. A pause is reversible, so destroying a real answer because
        of one is not something this engine does (REFUTATION-3 SM A
        consequence 3): the answer is RECORDED, the meter is charged, and
        nothing else happens until the founder resumes, after which the

        THE HOLD NOW COVERS THE ONLY ROUTE THE SHIPPED CLI HAS TO A PAUSE
        (REFUTATION-4 AZ F4). Round 4 held only on `run["state"] ==
        "PAUSED"`, which no shipped command reaches without a step() in
        between; a result arriving after `bm-autonomy pause` but before
        that step was judged in full, done_check and rollback included.
        The CONTRACT being paused is now the same hold.

        `summary`, when given, is an OUT parameter: the settle path writes
        its stop_reason, its note and its founder_gated block into it, so
        the caller (`bm-controller record-result`) can tell the founder
        that the result it just recorded also delivered the run, or that

        run, where the CONTRACT is what is paused, the meter CANNOT be

        the drop left no trace anywhere, so the breaker under-counted by
        exactly the held unit's cost with nothing to reconcile against,
        which is REFUTATION-3 SM C's own defect reopened for the new "held"
        outcome word.

        A checkpoint is the disclosure surface used rather than a founder
        step ON PURPOSE: queue_human_step gates the unit's whole LANE
        through select_ready_units, so disclosing a bookkeeping gap that
        way would block the very lane the founder is about to resume.
        record_checkpoint needs only SOME contract in any state and gates
        nothing.

        LIMIT, stated rather than hidden: this DISCLOSES the charge, it
        does not defer it. Charging it later is not implementable from this
        file alone, because Store.record_result carries no cost column, so
        the number is gone by the time the held answer is judged. See
        docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md and this round's report for the exact store
        change that would close it.

        WHAT ROUND 6 ADDED (REFUTATION-5 S7). The checkpoint alone was a
        disclosure nobody had to read, and the reachable magnitude was not
        "one unit's cost": pause, record-result, resume, step, once per
        unit, drove a whole run to DELIVERABLE_READY with 270 claimed
        tokens against a 100 token ceiling, metered 0, verdict `ok`, and
        ZERO open founder steps. A founder step is queued beside the
        checkpoint now, and _deliver_or_hold refuses to declare a
        deliverable while one is open, so a breaker that reads low cannot
        be reached through the shipped commands at all.

        The step goes in SPEND_RECONCILE_LANE, a lane no unit is ever
        planned into, which is what answers the objection above: it is

        position (see _RESULT_WALKABLE_STATES). Every consequence a

        the run state is the one thing deliberately left untouched:

          1. the verification is recorded, so the dispatch ends REJECTED
             instead of sitting open forever;
          2. the rejection is recorded against the unit;
          3. the founder is told, UNCONDITIONALLY, in the unit's OWN lane;
          4. the rollback runs, and the founder is warned when it left the
             write scope dirty (fault 10's warning, which the illegal
             state move used to swallow before it was ever written);
          5. the fence is parked, never left ACTIVE;
          6. an interruption names the late result and the run state, and
             is now genuinely best-effort, because step 3 has already told
             the founder when a stopped or revoked contract silences it.

        STEP 3 IS UNCONDITIONAL, and that is the change (REFUTATION-3 SM
        D). Round 3 put the founder step behind `if outcome['status'] !=
        'FAILED'`, and _record_interruption returns None whenever the
        contract is not live, which is one of the commonest reasons a run
        is in a late-result state at all. A unit at its retry ceiling
        therefore got NEITHER, and a real answer was discarded with
        `before=(0, 0) after=(0, 0)`. queue_human_step needs only SOME
        contract in any state, and a contract always exists once a run
        does, so nothing can silence this.

        BLOCK_LANE_UNITS IS GONE FROM THIS PATH (REFUTATION-3 SM F and LV
        2). The founder step in the unit's own lane is the whole mechanism:
        select_ready_units' blocked-lane query makes that lane unselectable
        on its own, so a stopped, paused or delivered run still gains no
        new selectable work. What is removed is BLOCKED written as an
        INDEPENDENT fact, which had no reverse gear anywhere in production
        and so was a one-way door. _reconcile_lane_blocks derives the same
        status from the step this method just queued, and reverses it the
        moment a founder resolves that step.

        AFTER the live-contract and spend checks (steps 2 and 3) rather

        interaction with the worker, and a contract that moved to
        stopped/revoked or a spend breaker that tripped must be able to
        drain instead of blindly re-asking a worker for an answer (fault

        to write a path they had just forbidden, with the fence over that
        path left active (REFUTATION-3 AZ F-A1, four shipped commands, no
        concurrency). Rejecting the answer afterwards, which the staleness
        re-read does, cannot un-write the file, which is the whole reason

    def _gate_check_write_scope(self, project_id, unit):
        """Step 2's gate_check for ONE unit, over its WHOLE write_scope,
        under ONE contract revision. Returns (verdict, refused_path), where
        refused_path is the path that earned a non-ALLOWED verdict, or None
        when the verdict was earned by the risk class alone (an empty
        write_scope, or a class/floor/state/breaker refusal on the first
        path checked).

        THE PROPERTY THIS ESTABLISHES, stated so a reader can hold the code
        to it: when this returns ALLOWED, EVERY path in the unit's
        write_scope was judged ALLOWED under the SAME contract revision,
        and that is the revision returned, which is the revision the
        dispatch is stamped with and the staleness re-read at step 13
        compares against. Two things are needed for that sentence to be
        true, and both were false before this round:

        ONE, the revision must not straddle the loop. Each gate_check is
        its own store read, so a `sign --supersede` amend from a second
        process can land BETWEEN two of them, leaving path 1 judged under
        the old contract while the dispatch is stamped with the new
        revision, at which point the staleness protocol sees no movement
        and accepts work the live contract forbids (R-L03-refutation-2 F2,
        probe_f2_revision_straddle). So: capture the FIRST verdict's
        revision, re-run the WHOLE loop once against the newer contract if
        any later verdict reports a different one, and if the revision
        moves again during that re-run, return _DEFERRED_CONTENTION so the
        caller defers the unit to a later wave. Deferral, not failure: a
        contract being amended twice inside one loop is contention, not an
        authorisation gap for this unit, and burning its retry or draining
        the run for it would punish the wrong thing.

        TWO, gate_check's own path comparison must be CONTAINMENT rather
        than overlap, or a unit could declare the PARENT of an allowed path
        and be authorised over every sibling the contract refuses by name
        (the same report's probe_f2b_ancestor_scope). That half of the
        property lives in the store, in Store.gate_check and
        bs.path_within_allowed; this method's claim depends on it.

        WHY EVERY PATH, not just the first: the design states this
        precondition twice and the two statements disagree. Section 1's
        `select` transition (design line 163) says "gate_check ALLOWED for
        the chosen unit's risk_class and write_scope", the whole scope;
        section 3 step 2's shorthand says `path=<write_scope[0]>`. The
        STRICTER reading wins, because allowed_paths is the founder's
        boundary on what the autonomous system may touch and gate_check is
        the ONLY component that ever compares a unit's scope against it:
        the fence claim (step 6) and the brief (_build_brief) both carry
        the FULL write_scope, so a forbidden path listed second would be
        claimed and handed to a worker as authorised, and the advisory
        after-the-fact net (bm_bash_audit) cannot catch it either, since
        the write IS inside the unit's own declared write_scope.

        read_scope is deliberately NOT gate-checked: the design's own
        precondition names risk_class and write_scope only, and
        gate_check's path check reads allowed_paths, a WRITE boundary.
        Gating reads on it would refuse units the contract permits.

        One call per DISTINCT path, in declaration order, short-circuiting
        on the first refusal (which is also what stops a REFUSED-STATE or
        REFUSED-BREAKER verdict from being followed by pointless further
        checks before the caller starts its drain).

        THE CONTAINER QUESTION IS ASKED FIRST, HERE, and not only by the
        dispatch route (REFUTATION-6 F4). `for path in unit["write_scope"]
        or []` is a TypeError for a scalar and a character shredder for a
        bare string, and round 6 put this method on the JUDGING path
        without carrying _authorise_dispatch's own first line across, so
        the SCOPE half of the authorisation refusal was not total: a
        non-iterable row left a traceback out of receive_result, and
        main() catches bs.BMStoreError and ValueError only.

        The ENTRY question (a pathspec, an option-looking path, a glob)
        is deliberately NOT asked here: it is asked where it is ACTED on,
        in _rollback_plan, which composes no command for such a row and

        property _gate_check_write_scope's docstring states and which the
        re-await route falsified for as long as it existed beside this one
        (REFUTATION-3 AZ F-A1).

        Steps 2 (per-unit gate_check over the unit's whole write_scope,
        capturing the revision the staleness re-read at step 13 compares
        against), 6 (claim files before dispatch) and 8 (record dispatch
        intent, durable before the worker runs). Never raises: a fence
        overlap is design step 5's parallel-fenced demotion ("any overlap
        demotes the pair to pipeline", realised here as "defer to a later
        wave"), a revision that moved twice inside the per-path gate check
        is the same deferral for contention rather than for an overlap, and
        a REFUSED-STATE or REFUSED-BREAKER verdict starts the whole-run
        drain, matching step 2's "a revoke that lands between check and
        act".

        BEFORE ANY OF THAT, the unit's write_scope must be a list of plain
        relative paths (REFUTATION-5 S1). gate_check judges a path against
        the founder's boundary; it does not ask whether the string is a
        path at all, and `:!keep.txt` is inside `allowed_paths ['.']` by
        every check the store makes while being 'everything except
        keep.txt' to git. So the shape is asked here, on the row as the

        (probe p11), both of which executed the unit's own model-authored
        done_check and then a `git restore` over the founder's files. A

        window between the read and the verdict is exactly as long as the
        founder's done_check, which in production is a test suite. A stop
        or a revoke landing inside it was classified by

        with ZERO commands executed (REFUTATION-4 AZ F5). Two answers,
        because the two conditions are not the same thing:

        PAUSED is REVERSIBLE, so the answer is HELD: nothing is recorded
        against the dispatch, no retry is burned, the fence stays where it
        is, and the run resumes judging it the moment the founder clears
        the contract. That is design 4.3's hold, reached from the one route
        that actually pauses a shipped run (AZ F4).

        STOPPED, REVOKED or GONE is not reversible by the founder pressing
        one key, and the authorisation this dispatch was stamped under no
        longer exists. The result is already recorded (it is real, and
        at-most-once recording still holds), so what is left is to say so
        durably and stop: a rejected verification carrying the reason, the
        unit returned through the circuit breaker, the fence PARKED rather
        than left active over the founder's files, and a founder step
        naming the unit and the dead contract, because a founder who pulled
        the kill switch mid-unit is owed the sentence "u1 answered after
        you stopped, and nothing was run".

        A THIRD ANSWER JOINED THEM IN ROUND 6 (REFUTATION-5 S2): the
        contract can be perfectly live and the FOUNDER'S OTHER BRAKE, the
        spend ceiling, can be what refuses. `refusal` carries the verdict
        _authorisation_refusal returned, so the sentence the founder reads
        names the brake that actually stopped the work rather than the one
        that did not. A breaker refusal is treated like the dead-contract
        branch, not like the pause: `step` already drains a run whose
        breaker has tripped, so holding an answer for a run that is about
        to drain would be a hold nothing ever collects.

        quoted command that restores the WHOLE working tree and exits 0,
        so every uncommitted founder edit in the project was destroyed and
        the zero exit meant no dirty-write-scope warning was ever queued.
        Two independent defences, either of which is enough:

          1. every emitted path goes through _pathspec_literal, so a magic
             spelling reaches git as a file name (and, being a file name
             nothing matches, exits 1, which IS the warning path);
          2. a scope this engine may not act on composes no command at
             all, and says so, so the founder learns the write scope was
             left exactly as the worker left it instead of being told
             nothing.

        The command emitted for an ordinary plain-path unit in a project
        that is not itself a git repository root is byte for byte the one
        this engine has always composed.

        A THIRD defence joined the two above (CROSS-FAMILY REFUTATION
        finding 3, HIGH, DATA DESTRUCTION), and it guards a different
        thing: not WHICH PATHS the command names, but WHICH REPOSITORY it
        acts on. git honours GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE over cwd, so this
        command, run from an environment carrying either, restored files
        in an unrelated repository and exited 0. _sanitised_env strips

        anything. Writes NO unit status: _reconcile_lane_blocks is what
        marks the newly gated lane BLOCKED, as a view.

        THE IDEMPOTENCY MARKER IS AN OPEN FOUNDER STEP IN THE UNIT'S OWN
        LANE, which is state-derived, needs no new column, and self-heals
        in both directions:

          * first wave: unreachable, lane ungated, one step per unreachable
            unit, the lane becomes gated, the reconcile marks it BLOCKED;
          * every later wave: the lane is gated, so nothing is queued. No
            spam, whatever drives step();
          * founder resolves without repairing: the lane ungates, the
            reconcile unblocks it, the unit is unreachable again and its
            lane ungated again, so ONE fresh round is queued. That is not
            spam, it is the condition still being true, restated once per
            founder action. LV 2's dead end (WAITING_HUMAN with ZERO open
            steps and nothing to resolve) is exactly this hole;
          * founder repairs and resolves: the lane ungates, the reconcile
            unblocks it including any healthy collateral, the unit is no
            longer unreachable, nothing is queued, and select_ready_units
            returns it.

        DEVIATION FROM DESIGN-round4 section 8.5, stated rather than
        silent: that section gates within the LOOP ("add that lane to
        gated_lanes so a second unit in the same lane does not queue a
        second step"), which would collapse two unreachable units sharing
        one lane into one step. A refutation-born assertion the design does
        not authorise changing (tools/test_bm_controller.py's
        test_a_transitively_blocked_unit_is_told_which_unit_actually_failed)
        requires each unreachable unit to get its OWN step naming its OWN
        chain, and that step text is the founder-facing value here: "unit
        u3 can never run: it depends on unit u2, and that chain ends at
        unit u1". So the gate is applied at WAVE granularity instead, which
        preserves the anti-spam property in full (the marker is still
        state-derived and still checked at the start of every wave) while
        keeping the per-unit explanation."""

# `resume` (PAUSED -> READY) and `complete` (DELIVERABLE_READY -> COMPLETE)
# are founder actions, never a controller self-move (design section 1's
# own words for the `complete` transition, and the same reasoning applies
# to reversing a pause); no ControllerEngine method performs either move,
# so these two commands call store.set_run_state directly and let the
# store's own CONTROLLER_STATE_TRANSITIONS legality check answer whether
# the move is allowed, the identical thin-CLI law tools/bm_autonomy.py's
# own pause/resume/stop/revoke already follow for the contract.
#
# EIGHT COMMANDS, matching the design's own file-plan (section 7) and
# Writer A's report (Cross-writer dependencies 1): start, step, plan,
# record-result, status, stop, resume, complete. check_timeouts is a real
# ControllerEngine method but is not wired to a subcommand here: a
# scheduler-driven deadline check is a later door on this same dispatch
# table, not a gap the design or this loop's own build instructions name.

    wave without outside help.

    WHY NOT engine.run_to_completion() DIRECTLY, reproduced rather than
    assumed: run_to_completion()'s own stop set does not include a wave
    that DISPATCHED a unit but recorded nothing synchronously ('pending';
    design section 4's RecordIntentWorker always returns this, since
    dispatch means record-intent-and-await, never a live model call from
    this process). Driving that through run_to_completion(project_id,
    max_steps=500) against the real production worker was reproduced
    printing the SAME unit brief to stdout up to 500 times in one `start`
    call, because step() re-awaits an open dispatch on every call and the
    run's own STATE stays EXECUTING throughout, which is not in the stop
    set. This wrapper stops the FIRST time a wave dispatches without a
    synchronous completion (the exact 'awaiting an out-of-band record-
    result call' case) or makes no progress at all, and only keeps
    looping while a wave is actually completing work (which can only
    happen against a synchronous test worker, or against a real, already
    -parked dispatch whose result has meanwhile arrived by some other
    channel), so a real `bm-controller start` call always returns
    promptly instead of busy-looping on its own printed brief.

    That reproduced reasoning still holds; what changed in round 4 is that
    the condition is no longer written out here by hand. Both drivers now
    stop on the SAME predicate, _loop_stops, which removes the divergence
    REFUTATION-3 LV 6a's own corollary names: the park stop round 3 added
    to run_to_completion was unreachable from the shipped CLI, because
    this wrapper already stopped earlier on a broader condition, so the
    two drivers disagreed about when a run was parked and only one of them
    was ever exercised. The case this docstring reproduces is now called
