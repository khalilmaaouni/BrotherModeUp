"""bench_env.py: the throwaway arm-environment builder for the installed-arm
benchmark (design build step 2, docs/program/absolute-lead/
DESIGN-benchmark-installed-arm.md, sections 1.1 and 5 step 2).

WHAT THIS IS
  A build-and-destroy tool for the one throwaway configuration each
  benchmark cell runs inside: a HOME the real machine never sees, a
  CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR the Claude Code client reads its plugin state from, and
  a BROTHERME_CONFIG file the product's own consent gate reads. Two arms
  use it: arm A gets an EMPTY CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (no plugin installed, plain
  Claude, the v2 control), arm B gets the product installed the shipped
  way. --arm selects which; the default is B, because that is the path
  this tool exists to prove works at all.

WHERE THE PATTERN COMES FROM, NAMED RATHER THAN GUESSED
  The plugin install sequence and its three asserts (the success lines, the
  version matching VERSION, and the hook group count from
  tools/bm_project_facts.py --field hook_count) are copied from
  scripts/release-smoke-install.sh, which proves the same install with the
  real Claude Code client at release time. The environment-building shape
  (a from-scratch copy of the real environment, every GIT_ name stripped
  because git honours GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE over cwd, every
  BrotherMode-recognized variable stripped before being explicitly
  repinned) is the pattern scripts/rehearse_fresh_install.py's build_env()
  already uses. Consent is granted the shipped way: scripts/setup.py flag
  mode against BROTHERME_CONFIG inside the throwaway HOME, exactly as
  scripts/rehearse_fresh_install.py step 4 and
  scripts/benchmark_comparative.py's probe_installed() already do. None of
  these three files is imported here: every script in this project stays
  self-contained and duplicates a proven pattern rather than reaching
  across scripts/ for it (the same policy
  scripts/rehearse_fresh_install.py's _mask_home states in its own
  comments), so the exact command spellings below are copied by hand from
  the files named above, not reinvented from memory.

THE VAULT-LEAK LESSON, ALSO ENCODED HERE
  tools/bm_ledger.py, and its siblings, resolve their storage from
  BROTHERMODE_VAULT / BROTHERSBE_VAULT when either is exported in the
  invoking shell, which WINS OVER HOME. A HOME-only override was measured
  writing a live row into a real, non-throwaway vault (the incident
  tools/test_bm_plugin_install.py's own module docstring records, and
  docs/closure/specs/2026-08-04-c06-packaging.md, INCIDENT DURING
  VERIFICATION). Every environment this file builds pins HOME,
  BROTHERMODE_VAULT and BROTHERSBE_VAULT into the same throwaway
  directory, explicitly assigned rather than merely unset, so an ambient
  export in the calling shell can never win the way it did there.

THE PERSISTENT-AUTH FOLDER, MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED
  scripts/benchmark_comparative.py's _probe_env() docstring records two
  facts measured on this machine on 2026-08-07: the claude binary's login
  rides the real HOME's keychain (a throwaway HOME always reads "not
  logged in", whatever CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR says), and plugin state is scoped
  entirely by CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (a persistent config dir shows only its own
  installs, none of a dogfood install's). BM_BENCH_AUTH_CONFIG, when set in
  the environment this tool is run under, names a founder-authenticated
  CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR this tool reuses instead of building a throwaway one:
  the real HOME is then left unoverridden so the keychain-backed login
  still resolves, and nothing is ever copied out of it, no credential file
  included. A path named by BM_BENCH_AUTH_CONFIG is NEVER deleted by this
  tool, on any exit path; every other directory this tool builds always is.
  This tool's own --build --check done-check never sets that variable, so
  its own run always installs into, and destroys, a fully throwaway
  configuration.

USAGE
  python3 scripts/bench_env.py --build --check [--arm A|B] [--keep]
      build one throwaway arm environment, verify it, print its content
      digests, then destroy it. --arm B (the default) installs the plugin
      the shipped way and grants consent; --arm A leaves CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
      empty, the plain control. Exit 0 PASSED, exit 1 FAILED (the build or
      one of its asserts broke), exit 2 BLOCKED (no claude binary on PATH,
      or BM_BENCH_AUTH_CONFIG names no directory).

Python 3.9, standard library only. No em or en dashes anywhere in this
file, its comments, or its output.
