"""bm_sentinel.py: Phase 1 of the Memory Sentinel, the deterministic,
silence-biased memory selector plus its command line.

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-02-memory-sentinel-phase1-design.md,
sections 4 (the pure selection policy) and 5 (this command line). This file
implements those two sections only. The schema and Store methods (section 3)
are owned by a different implementer working in a separate worktree at the
same time, so every Store call here is written against the spec's documented
signatures and has never been run against a live Store from this file.

THE FOUR LAWS select() enforces by construction, each meant to be proven by
its own named test in tools/test_bm_sentinel.py rather than assumed:

1. select() never returns more than one memory. One reminder, one moment.
2. select() never returns a sentinel_status row: it has no status parameter
   at all, so there is nothing to return by accident.
3. Every silent return carries a non-empty reason string.
4. An unknown trigger raises ValueError naming the allowed set. It never
   falls through to a silent return, because a typo that reads as "the
   sentinel chose silence" is indistinguishable from working software.

select(trigger, context, knowledge, procedural, recent_interventions) is
PURE: no I/O, no store access, no clock read. It takes plain lists of dicts
and returns (decision, memories, reason), so a test suite can drive every one
of its seven ordered branches with data alone: nothing to say, cooldown,
post_failure, pre_risky, resume, phase_boundary, tool_interval.

The command line is a thin layer over tools/bm_store.py's Store methods,
imported lazily inside each command function (never at module load), so this
file imports cleanly and select() stays testable even while bm_store.py is
mid-edit in a parallel worktree.

Eight commands: remember-knowledge, remember-procedural, status-set, check,
judge, list, stats, retire. Exit codes, matching tools/bm_ledger.py's own
convention: EXIT_OK, EXIT_REFUSED, EXIT_USAGE = 0, 1, 2. `check` exits 0
whether it injects or stays silent, because silence is a successful outcome
of the command, not a failure of it; exit 1 is reserved for a refusal
(unknown project, invalid enum, a write that matched no row), exit 2 for
usage.
