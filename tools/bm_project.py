"""bm_project.py: the mechanical command line for the seven beginner
commands (Loop 2, docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-loop2-mechanical-
commands-design.md, decisions D-1 and D-4), plus export and purge (WP-H,
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-loop6-security-closure-design.md, D-3).

WHAT THIS IS
  A THIN CLI over tools/bm_store.py's Store service methods (upsert_project,
  create_task, transition_task, add_forecast, raise_alert, resolve_alert,
  add_evidence, purge_project) and its D-2 read accessors (get_project,
  list_projects, list_tasks, get_task, list_dependencies, list_forecasts,
  latest_forecast, list_alerts, list_evidence, list_attribution). This file
  never issues SQL of its own: the flip condition in D-1 is exactly that,
  and the moment this file needs a query the store does not already offer,
  it has become a second writer and must be folded back into bm_store.py
  instead of growing one here. A structural guard test
  (tools/test_bm_project.py) greps this file's own source for the four SQL
  write and read statement keywords (case sensitive, the way every real
  query in bm_store.py itself is written) and fails the build if any
  appear.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
  Not a second store, not a second writer, not a place that reimplements
  the ten-state lifecycle law: every transition goes through
  Store.transition_task, which calls schema.transition(), which is the one
  place that law is enforced. This file only ever reports what that
  function decided, in its own words.

                          preview first without deleting anything

WHY create=False EVERYWHERE
  Matching bm_store.py's own CLI convention (its cmd_claim and every other
  command besides init): "only init creates a store" only means something
  if every other path refuses instead of quietly creating one. Run
  `python3 tools/bm_store.py init` first.

ONE PROJECT PER FOLDER (the beginner model; C5, release-closure loop2
refuter fixes)
  A root holds ONE project's CANVAS.md and ONE DELIVERY-PACKET.md by
  default: that is the beginner model this whole file is built around, and
  it is also what keeps those two generated views unambiguous (start and
  deliver regenerate them from "the project in this root", not from a
  project_id a founder has to remember to keep straight). `start` refuses
  to create a SECOND, different project_id in a root that already holds
  one, naming the existing project id in its refusal, unless
  --allow-second is passed on purpose. Re-running `start` on the SAME
  project_id (an update) is never a "second project" and is never
  refused. Once a root genuinely holds more than one project,
  _canvas_filename/_packet_filename switch every further start/deliver in
  that root to a project-scoped name (CANVAS-<project_id>.md,
  DELIVERY-PACKET-<project_id>.md) so a second project's generated views
  can never silently overwrite the first's.

RAW LOCAL DISPLAY VERSUS REDACTED EXPORT (loop2 redaction-policy fix)
  The D-2 accessors redact through the SAME export_column policy dump()
  uses, and _DUMP_SAFE_COLUMNS in bm_store.py now lists identifiers,
  schema enums, timestamps and other machine labels for the schema-12
  tables (projects, tasks, forecasts, dependencies, attribution, alerts,
  evidence, runtime_runs), the same discipline every other exported table
  already had. Every founder-typed prose column (name, title, goal,
  message, reason, note, and the rest) still stays withheld by default:
  that part of the policy is unchanged and is not what this file works
  around.

  What this file adds is WHERE raw=True is used. Human-readable terminal
  output (status, next, review, deliver) and the two generated documents
  (CANVAS.md, DELIVERY-PACKET.md) all read through the accessors with
  raw=True: local display and a locally generated document for the data's
  own owner are not an export, so there is nothing to withhold from the
  founder reading their own project on their own machine. --json output
  and the export command's own json file are the actual export surfaces
  and stay REDACTED BY DEFAULT, exactly like bm_store.py's own dump; pass
  --raw to see either unredacted, the same named, explicit escape hatch
  dump --raw already uses. Generated documents still
  pass through bs.write_generated_document before they touch disk, whose
  redact_text funnel is the FINAL guard: raw=True decides what this file
  is willing to try to show, redact_text decides what a secret-shaped
  string is allowed to survive as, and the two are independent layers on
  purpose (a task title that happens to contain something secret-shaped is
  still caught there even though raw=True populated the content).

  SBE15 (2026-08-16): DELIVERY-PACKET.md is a shareable artifact by name,
  and redact_text is the ONLY guard on this raw=True path (a sibling lane
  is fixing a defect where content can disable that guard). Every
  founder-typed prose field render_canvas/render_delivery_packet place into
  either document (name, goal, user_outcome, a task title, an evidence ref,
  an attribution actor name, and list fields like risks or scope) now
  passes through the local _prose() helper, which runs it through
  tools/bm_learning.py's safe_display, the same control-character
  containment tools/bm_packs.py runs store text through before a screen or
  a page. This is a SECOND, independent layer, not a fix for redact_text's
  own defect: safe_display strips control characters and caps length, it
  does not recognize a secret. What it buys: even if redact_text is
  defeated by content, a founder-typed field can no longer forge a fake
  markdown heading or an extra section in the generated document by
  embedding a newline plus markdown syntax. What it does not buy: it does
  not stop a secret-shaped string, in ordinary prose with no control
  characters, from reaching the page if redact_text itself is bypassed;
  closing that is the sibling lane's job, not this file's.
