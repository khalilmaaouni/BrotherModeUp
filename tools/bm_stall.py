"""bm_stall.py: the active stall, dead-owner, and orphan sweep.

Loop SD (docs/plan/PROGRAM-PLAN-2026-08-10.md, section "Loop SD"; SD.1
through SD.3 in docs/program/category-ownership/PROGRAM-2026-08-11.md,
section 11, "LOOP SD: Active stall, dead-owner, and orphan recovery").

WHY THIS EXISTS
  Five real fences went stale on 2026-08-10 (README.md, SKILL.md twice, the
  findings ledger, the narrowing work itself) and nobody noticed until a
  founder read STATE.md by hand. The watchdog that should have caught this
  died with its own session. Nine provisional records sat with no living
  owner. tools/bm_controller.py already heartbeats (:1797) and resumes
  orphans (:2434) -- but ONLY inside a running Full-Auto controller. Nothing
  sweeps the store's own fences and claims when NO controller is running,
  which is the ordinary state of an interactive session. This file is that
  sweep.

WHAT THIS DOES (SD1, SD2, SD5)
  SD1 -- owner_liveness(): one pure function, several weak signals combined
    (process liveness, heartbeat age, controller-run registration), NEVER
    pid alone. See its own docstring for the PID-reuse caveat.
  SD2 -- sweep(): a pure-read pass over a store's active records (this
    project's own name for a "fence"), their claims, and their provisional
    records, reporting Findings: stale fence, dead watchdog, dead-owner
    provisional record, and duplicate/overlapping active claims (a state
    the store's own write-time checks should prevent, kept here as a drift
    detector the same way bm_store.verify() keeps its own dupes/overlap
    check for exactly that reason).
  SD5 -- every Finding carries the EXACT `bm_store`/`bm_learn` command that
    would clear it, as a STRING. Nothing in this file ever executes one
    (dashboard decision D-3, PROGRAM-PLAN.md's own words: "sweep and
    propose only... deliberately OUT of SD: auto-adopt or auto-release").

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO (left as explicit deltas for other steps)
  SD3 -- registering this module in tools/bm_effects.py's REGISTRY as
    pure_read is a change to THAT file, not this one.
  SD4 -- wiring `sweep` into tools/bm_sessionstart.sh (fail-open, the same
    way tools/bm_progress_check.py is wired there today) is a change to
    that shell script.
  SD6 -- registering this module and its test in tools/test_all.py, the CI
    workflow, pyproject.toml, tools/write_sites.json, and CHECKSUMS.sha256
    (the four-places-plus-checksums contract) are changes to those files.
  None of the five are made here; see the delta list this session reported
  alongside this file.

A KNOWN, STATED GAP: NO PID IS EVER RECORDED PER SESSION TODAY
  tools/bm_store.py's own session ids are opaque random tokens
  ("cli-<uuid4 hex>", or whatever a caller passes to --session); no table
  in the schema stores a process id against one. So `sweep()` always
  computes pid=None, pid_alive=None for every real record it reads: process
  liveness is a signal this oracle KNOWS how to use (see owner_liveness),
  but the store gives it nothing to use today. `pid_hints` is the
  documented extension point -- an optional {session_id: pid} map a caller
  who has out-of-band knowledge (a future session-pid registry, SD4/SD6's
  own territory) may pass in. Passing none is honest, not a defect; a
  liveness oracle that pretended to check a signal it cannot see would be
  the more dangerous of the two wrong answers.

ANOTHER KNOWN, STATED GAP: THE FOREIGN-COMMIT-BASE CHECK IS STANDALONE
  foreign_commit_base_finding() is a pure function that takes a claimed
  base commit sha and the current HEAD sha as PARAMETERS -- this module
  spawns no subprocess (pure_read forbids it), so nothing here ever runs
  `git`. It is not wired into sweep()'s default output because no table in
  today's schema records which commit a claim was made against; a caller
  who already has both shas (an ordinary `git rev-parse` a session or a
  future hook already ran) may call it directly.

EFFECT CLASS: pure_read
  This file writes NOT ONE BYTE anywhere, ever. It opens the store only
  through bm_store.ReadOnlyStore (never bm_store.Store, whose own
  construction is itself a write -- WAL/SHM sidecars, git-excludes,
  chmod, a possible schema migration; see tools/bm_effects.py's module
  docstring for the measured root cause this project keeps rediscovering).
  Every SD5 "clearing verb" is a STRING built from data already in hand,
  never a subprocess.run call. No network. No subprocess.

BE SILENT-SAFE
  Any unexpected exception anywhere in a sweep is reported as NO-DATA
  (exit 2), never silently treated as "nothing found" (exit 0): a sweep
  that cannot read the store must never be mistaken for a store with
  nothing wrong in it. Mirrors tools/bm_progress_check.py's own contract.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. No subprocess.
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.

Usage:
  python3 tools/bm_stall.py [sweep] [--root PATH] [--now ISO8601]
    [--stale-seconds N] [--pid-hint SESSION_ID=PID] [--json]

`sweep` is the only verb and is also the default when no verb is given.

    THE PID-REUSE CAVEAT (SD.1's own words: "PID reuse must not be treated
    as sufficient proof of liveness"). `signals.pid_alive is True` is NEVER,
    by itself, enough to return LIVE anywhere in this function. A pid that
    answers signal 0 only PROVES some process holds that number right now;
    the operating system reissues pids, and a long-idle owner's pid can
    already belong to an unrelated program by the time this runs. pid_alive
    is used two ways only: pid_alive is False is treated as real evidence
    of death (a process that is confirmed GONE strengthens a stale verdict,
    though it is still not the only thing decided on); pid_alive is True
    is used ONLY as one more fact folded into an otherwise-live picture --
    never as the deciding fact on its own.

    THE RULES, IN ORDER:
      1. A fresh heartbeat (age <= stale_after_seconds) is corroborated
         reality: LIVE.
      2. Failing that, a session still registered as the live driver of a
         controller run is the strongest remaining signal this store
         offers: LIVE.
      3. Failing both, no heartbeat evidence exists at all: UNKNOWN. This
         is not "assume alive" and not "assume dead"; it is "this sweep
         cannot tell", and callers must not treat UNKNOWN as either LIVE
         or DEAD by default (see sweep()'s own handling).
      4. Failing that (a real but STALE heartbeat, no live controller
         registration): DEAD. pid_alive is True is annotated into the
         reason as an EXPLICIT non-decision, naming the PID-reuse caveat
         by name, so a founder reading a stale-fence finding is never left
         thinking "but the process answered, so maybe it is fine".
