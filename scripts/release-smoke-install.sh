# The public-install smoke: the release step no release may skip.
# Proves, with the real Claude Code client, that a stranger's install is
# two boring commands, that what installs is what this tree ships, and
# that uninstalling leaves their settings clean.
#
# Runs the whole flow inside a throwaway CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, so the machine
# it runs on is never touched. No sign-in is needed: marketplace add and
# plugin install are local mechanics.
#
# Default source is THIS TREE (path mode), so the gate proves the release
# candidate before it is pushed. Pass --github to prove the public path
# after the push instead.
#
# Exit 0 PASSED. Exit 1 FAILED (a step broke: the release stops). Exit 2
# BLOCKED: no claude binary on this machine; the release checklist in
# docs/RELEASE.md forbids proceeding until it is run somewhere real,
# because continuous integration has no Claude client and cannot carry
# this proof. A BLOCKED exit is not a pass. No em or en dashes.
