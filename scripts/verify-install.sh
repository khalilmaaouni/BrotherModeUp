# verify-install.sh: does an installed copy of this repository match a
# published checksum manifest, byte for byte?
#
# This is the direct answer to "how do I know what I installed". The
# install instruction (docs/RELEASE.md, README.md) clones a git ref into
# ~/.claude/skills/brothermode, and that code then runs automatically on
# every Claude Code session via hooks. A manifest you cannot check against
# is not a security control, it is a claim; this script is the check.
#
# POSIX sh only, no bashisms, same portability intent as checksums.sh: run
# directly under both bash and dash to confirm neither rejects it. Uses no
# git commands itself, on purpose: it only ever reads the manifest and
# re-hashes the files it names, so it works identically on a plain
# directory copy (no .git present) and on a real clone.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-install.sh [manifest-file] [installed-dir]
#
#   manifest-file  defaults to <installed-dir>/CHECKSUMS.sha256
#   installed-dir  defaults to this script's own parent repository root
#
# Typical use: you cloned a tagged release into
# ~/.claude/skills/brothermode. The release ships CHECKSUMS.sha256 at the
# repository root (docs/RELEASE.md, step "cut the release", explains how a
# maintainer produces it with checksums.sh). Run this with no arguments
# from inside that clone, or point it at any two directories explicitly:
#
#   scripts/verify-install.sh
#   scripts/verify-install.sh /path/to/CHECKSUMS.sha256 ~/.claude/skills/brothermode
#   scripts/verify-install.sh --selftest   # checks the gitignored-extra split, see below

set -e

# Self-check for the gitignored-extra split below (git-repo branch only; the
# non-git branch is untouched by this change and needs no new check). No
# framework, no new file to register in any registry: it builds a scratch
# git repo under mktemp, calls this same script against it twice, and
# asserts the two outcomes the split promises. Run it directly with
# `scripts/verify-install.sh --selftest`.

# scripts/checksums.sh already applies when it cannot use git (kept in
# sync by comment in both files, since each script is self-contained POSIX
# sh with no shared file to hold this list once): machine state and
# generated files this project's own .gitignore already keeps out of what
# git tracks, so their absence from the manifest is expected, not an added
# file. Stated limit: if $TARGET itself contains a character `find -path`
# treats as glob syntax (*, ?, [ ]), the exclusions below can under- or
# over-match; named here rather than silently assumed correct.

# FINDING 4 (2026-07-27): this enumeration used to say `-type f`, and that
# one flag was a hole straight through the whole check. POSIX find without
# -L does not follow symlinks, so a symlink is -type l and NEVER matches
# -type f: an unmanifested symlink was invisible to this loop, and invisible
# to the manifest loop above too, because the manifest by definition never
# named it. The attack that exercised it: plant tools/json.py as a symlink to
# an attacker-controlled file, and this script prints PASSED and exits 0,
# while every session hook that runs `python3 tools/bm_telemetry.py` loads
# the attacker's module first, because Python puts the script's own directory
# at the front of sys.path and shadowing the standard library from there is
# trivial. Reproduced end to end before the fix (exit 0, nothing reported).
#
# `! -type d` is the fix: it enumerates EVERY non-directory entry, which is
# regular files, symlinks (including symlinks that point at directories,
# which are type l and not type d), devices, FIFOs and sockets. Real
# directories are the only thing left out, and a real directory is inert
# here: it holds no bytes of its own, nothing executes it, and anything
# inside it is enumerated on its own account. The excluded roots are now
# also matched as bare names, not only as "<root>/*" prefixes, because a
# symlink NAMED .brothermode or threads was previously skipped for free by
# -type f and would otherwise walk right back in through the exclusion list.
# find is not asked to descend through any link (no -L, deliberately), so
# nothing below a planted link is traversed or trusted.
