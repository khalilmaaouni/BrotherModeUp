"""The hook contract: every automatic hook must be runnable on a machine
with python3 and nothing else.

Standard library only. Run: python3 tools/test_bm_hooks.py

WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS (the Windows lane, 2026-08-17). hooks/hooks.json
carried one `sh <script>` entry and two `sh -c` chains for weeks after
scripts/doctor.py grew a check that FAILED on Windows naming them, because
nothing refused the wiring itself: the doctor told the user, and no gate
told the author. This suite is that gate, the same contract the sibling
repository holds in its own hook suite (TestHookContract): every wired
command starts with python3, no command anywhere contains an `sh -c` or
`bash -c` wrapper, and the heavy PreCompact entry declares a timeout. A
future hook that reaches for a shell fails HERE, by name, before any user
installs it.

Stated plainly, because claiming otherwise would be the overclaim this
repository lints against: a python3-only manifest makes the hooks RUNNABLE
on Windows in principle, and Windows behavior remains UNVERIFIED until a
real Windows machine executes them. docs/WINDOWS-CHECK.md is the protocol
for closing that; this suite closes only the wiring half.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.

    THE LAW, quoted: "the engine speaks plain git only (never gh, never a
    host API, in tools/ or hooks/)". It was written on 2026-08-16 and until
    now it lived entirely in prose, which means it was enforced by whoever
    happened to remember it. This class is the check. A module under tools/
    or a command under hooks/ that reaches for a host API fails HERE, by
    name, rather than being noticed by an adopter whose remote is on the
    other host.

    WHAT COUNTS AS A VIOLATION is narrower than a keyword, on purpose: a
    host NAME in a documentation string, a canonical repository URL, or a
    comment about a redaction pattern breaks nothing and blocks nobody. What
    breaks an adopter is CODE that calls a host: an import of a client
    library, an invocation of `gh`, or a request against a host API
    endpoint. Matching on mentions instead would produce a check everybody
    learns to work around by rephrasing a comment, which is worse than no
    check.

    host API, and it is named here with its reason rather than excluded by a
