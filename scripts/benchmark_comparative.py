"""BrotherMode comparative benchmark harness: L12 of the release program.

WHAT THIS IS
  Six fixed tasks, two arms, frozen scoring. Arm A is plain `claude -p`
  headless with the task prompt. Arm B is the same model and the same task
  prompt with the BrotherMode skill digest (skills/brotherme/SKILL.md, read at
  run time) injected into the prompt preamble. Every task builds its OWN
  throwaway git repository under a temporary directory, the way
  scripts/benchmark.py does, and every deterministic check is strictly PASS or
  FAIL with no partial credit. The protocol, the rubric, and the honesty rules
  live in docs/BENCHMARK-COMPARATIVE.md and are frozen before any recorded
  run: an edit to tasks or rubric after the first recorded run voids the
  numbers.

WHAT IT IS NOT
  It is not the public benchmark (scripts/benchmark.py) and it is not the test
  suite (tools/test_all.py). Every number it produces is INTERNAL EVIDENCE:
  self-graded, one machine, no outside user. It proves nothing about anyone
  else's results and it never supports a market claim.

HONESTY RULES THIS FILE FOLLOWS
  - A cell that cannot run prints SKIP with the reason and exits 1. A SKIP is
    never a pass and is never counted.
  - Calibration is mandatory and executable: `--dry-run` runs every
    deterministic check against untouched fixtures and exits 0 only when
    every check FAILS there. A check that passes with no work done is broken,
    and the dry run says which one.
  - A harness defect (a transcript that cannot be parsed, a timeout, a crash)
    counts against the harness, never against an arm. It is recorded as SKIP
    with the reason, not as a FAIL for the arm.
  - No default invocation runs a model arm. Running a cell takes an explicit
    `--task Tn --arm A|B`, so nothing spends tokens silently.
  - Observed output is quoted from commands and artifacts, never paraphrased.

USAGE
  python3 scripts/benchmark_comparative.py --list
      print the six tasks and their deterministic checks, exit 0
  python3 scripts/benchmark_comparative.py --dry-run [--task Tn]
      build fixtures, run every check with no model run, prove all RED
  python3 scripts/benchmark_comparative.py --task T1 --arm A
      run one cell for real and write its artifacts
  optional with --task: --arm A|B (required), --model <id>, --run-id <id>
  python3 scripts/benchmark_comparative.py --probe-installed
      the M19-class go/no-go canary for the installed arm (design step 1,
      docs/program/absolute-lead/DESIGN-benchmark-installed-arm.md section
      1.1.9): builds a throwaway HOME, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and
      BROTHERME_CONFIG, installs the plugin the shipped way, grants
      consent the shipped way, seeds a rival fence claim on one fixture
      file, and drives ONE real headless claude session asking for a
      trivial edit to that file. Exits 0 printing HOOK FIRED with the
      deny quoted on a pass, exits 1 printing SKIP: <reason> on anything
      else (a missing or unauthenticated claude binary, a failed install
      or consent step, or the hook staying silent). Writes nothing
      outside its own throwaway temporary directories, which it deletes
      on exit.
  exit codes: 0 requested operation succeeded, 1 a SKIP, a harness defect or
  broken calibration, 2 bad arguments

  Artifacts land under docs/program/absolute-lead/evidence/BENCH/
  <run id>/<task>/<arm>/ as transcript.txt, diff.patch, checks.json and
  manifest.json. The harness writes NOTHING else outside its temporary
  fixture directories.

Python 3.9, standard library only. It lives under scripts/ and not tools/ for
the same reason scripts/benchmark.py does: it drives real command lines as
subprocesses, which the shipping tools may not do.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output. The harness's own
printed output is pure ASCII; model transcripts are written to artifact files
verbatim and sanitized before any line of them is printed.

    canary, run for real. Raises Skip for every non-pass outcome (a missing
    or unauthenticated claude binary, a failed install or consent step, or
    the fence staying silent); main() turns that into "SKIP: <reason>" and
    exit 1, exactly as dry_run and run_cell already do. On a pass this
    prints HOOK FIRED plus the quoted deny and returns normally, and main()
    turns that into exit 0.

    THE SEVEN MOVES, in order:
      1. confirm a claude binary exists at all (a missing one is SKIP, not
         a crash)
      2. build a throwaway HOME, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and fixture directory
      3. install the plugin the shipped way: `claude plugin marketplace
         add <this tree>` then `claude plugin install
         brothermode@brothermode-marketplace`, with the same three asserts
         scripts/release-smoke-install.sh already makes (success lines,
         the version matching VERSION, the hook group count from
         tools/bm_project_facts.py --field hook_count), reused verbatim
         rather than reinvented
      4. grant consent the shipped way: scripts/setup.py flag mode against
         BROTHERME_CONFIG inside the throwaway HOME, exactly as
         scripts/rehearse_fresh_install.py step 4 does; without this the
         consent gate would rightly hold the product back and the canary
         would measure the gate, not the fence
      5. seed the fixture: one file, committed, then fenced by a RIVAL
         session whose label is materialized through the fence tool's own
         --session-id path, so the claim is a real claim and not a
         fabricated label
      6. drive ONE real headless `claude -p` session, no --safe-mode (that
         flag disables hooks, CLAUDE.md, skills and plugins entirely,
         which would guarantee silence and prove nothing), asking for a
         trivial edit to the fenced file
      7. measure: the canary passes only if the parsed stream's own
         structured record (result.permission_denials) shows a genuine
         tool-call denial for the fence-gated file AND the fixture file
         is byte identical afterward; anything else is SKIP with the
         precise reason measured. A raw substring search over the
         transcript is no longer the decision (codex finding 10, v3
         gap-closure cross-family review): it is kept only to quote the
         fence's own wording for a human reader.
