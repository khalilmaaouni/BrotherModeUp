"""Regression tests for tools/bm_autosave.py, the Phase 2 recovery rewrite
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-phase2-recovery-design.md). Standard
library only. Run: python3 tools/test_bm_autosave.py

Every TestCalibrated* class reproduces one row of the spec's defect table.
Each proves two things in one method: the REAL product code does the right
thing today, and monkeypatching the exact PRODUCT function responsible for
that fix back to its old shape makes the SAME check fail for the SAME
reason the defect describes. The second half is the calibration proof: a
test that would pass no matter what the implementation does is not testing
anything. Every reinjection here patches a real, named function on the
imported bm_autosave module object, never a private local copy of old code
(a prior version of this project deleted 24 tests for exactly that mistake).

Every test is self-contained under tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() and never
touches this repo's own git state, BROTHERMODE_VAULT, or the real home
directory.

# CROSS-FAMILY REFUTATION finding 3 (HIGH, DATA DESTRUCTION), at THIS module.
#
# tools/bm_controller.py closed this for the commands it runs. The same hole
# was open here, and this module is the one whose entire job is not losing
# work. Every git call in bm_autosave.py carries `-C <toplevel>`, and
# `git -C` does NOT beat GIT_DIR or GIT_WORK_TREE. Measured on this machine
# (git 2.50.1, Apple Git-155) in two throwaway repositories P and Q:
#
#     plain:    git -C P rev-parse --show-toplevel  ->  .../P
#     poisoned: GIT_DIR=.../Q/.git GIT_WORK_TREE=.../Q
#               git -C P rev-parse --show-toplevel  ->  .../Q
#
# So an autosave fired from an environment carrying those names (a git hook,
# a wrapper script, another repository's tooling) resolved a DIFFERENT
# repository as its toplevel and then ran the entire pipeline against it:
# the founder's unsaved work in P was never captured, Q's working tree was
# committed into refs nobody asked for, Q's own snapshot refs became
# eligible for this run's retention prune, and the receipt recorded success.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: The environment names that REDIRECT git (they move where it reads, where
#: it writes, or which config it obeys, which is the same thing once
#: core.worktree can be injected). Enumerated against git 2.50.1 as the
#: union of git(1)'s ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section, git-config(1)'s
#: environment section, and `strings` over the shipped binary; the same
#: enumeration tools/test_bm_controller.py carries, repeated here rather
#: than imported so this suite still stands alone. Thirteen of these appear
#: in NO git(1) environment section, which is why the shipped rule is a
#: PREFIX and not a list.
