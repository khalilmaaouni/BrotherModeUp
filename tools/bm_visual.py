"""bm_visual: the drawn vocabulary of BrotherMode's visual surface.

Design: docs/program/absolute-lead/DESIGN-visual-surface.md, sections 6
(the insight box and the alert ladder), 7 (the diagram vocabulary), 9.2
(the failure block) and 12.1 (this inventory).

WHAT THIS FILE IS. One vocabulary, two renderings. Seven shapes, four
alert rungs, one six slot insight box, one derived alert function and one
map that rewrites every refusal the engine can emit into words a founder
can act on. Everything here is a pure function of rows that already
exist: there is no picture anybody maintains by hand, and there is no
alerts table, because a stored alert is a lie the moment its condition
clears.

Loop after v2.1.0 (docs/program/absolute-lead/DESIGN-progress-surface.md)
added the sixth shape, timeline, and progress_facts, the one pure reader
that feeds the progress page section: still rows in, plain facts out,
still no second truth. Phase 5 (founder decision 2026-08-08) added the
seventh, gantt, and the progress view that draws it.

The count in the paragraph above is the one thing on this page nothing
computes. It said six while SHAPES already held seven, for the same
reason references/visual-surface.md said five: a widened tuple leaves
prose behind. tools/test_bm_docs.py now reads this docstring against
SHAPES, so the third time is caught rather than shipped.

WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. It is not a command: it has no main, it opens no
store of its own, it writes no file and it prints nothing. Every entry
point either takes an already-open store handle or takes plain data. The
consent gate therefore lives where the commands live (tools/bm_view.py),
and this module cannot break it because it can never obtain a handle by
itself.

THE FOUR LAWS THIS FILE ENFORCES MECHANICALLY, rather than by prose:

  L-S4  Colour is the third carrier. Every status is recoverable from a
        WORD first, a non colour mark second, and colour third. to_svg
        emits no colour attribute at all; every colour in the product
        lives in THEME_CSS, so the test that deletes that block and
        asserts every status is still readable is trivial rather than
        aspirational.
  L-S5  One vocabulary, two renderings. Every shape renders as plain
        ASCII for a terminal and as inline SVG for the page, and the two
        carry the same status words. A concept that works in only one of
        the two does not enter the vocabulary.
  L-S6  Alerts are derived, never stored. alerts_now is a pure, ordered,
        deduplicated, capped function over rows.
  L-S9  A refusal never reaches the founder unrewritten. REFUSAL_HELP has
        an entry for every reason code tools/bm_store.py can emit AND for
        every one tools/bm_controller.py's unattended preflight refuses
        with, and a test enumerates them from those two files' own
        sources.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network, at render time or ever.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.

# pass silently.
#
# Hue anchors are the Colour Universal Design ones: vermilion for the stop
# rung rather than pure red, because dark red reads as black to
# protanopes; bluish green rather than green; blue and sky blue separated
# by brightness. The rungs alternate warm and cool going down the ladder.

# 5. THE SEVEN SHAPES, AND NOTHING ELSE
#
# Seven allowed shapes against roughly twenty five available. Graphic
# economy is the point, not a side effect. The ban is enforced by
# Diagram() raising, not by prose, because a ban enforced by prose gets
# broken in month three by somebody with a really good reason for a pie
# chart.
#
# The seventh is "gantt" (Phase 5, founder decision 2026-08-08). Admitted
# deliberately rather than folded into "timeline", because the two answer
# different questions and share only a word: timeline draws how far a
# piece has moved through its lifecycle, grouped by who owns it; gantt
# draws how long a piece took, grouped by the phase it belongs to. Fusing
# them would have meant one shape whose bars mean two things depending on
# the data, which is worse than seven honest shapes.
#
# The count in this heading and in Diagram()'s refusal is maintained by
# hand and was WRONG until this loop: it read "five" while SHAPES already
# held six, because the timeline addition widened the tuple and left the
# sentence behind. Fixed here, and the refusal below now derives its
# count from the tuple so the two can never disagree again.

# 7b. PROGRESS FACTS: rows in, plain facts out, NO STORE HANDLE
#
# DESIGN-progress-surface.md item 2. Unlike visual_facts above, this takes
# already-fetched rows rather than a store handle: a function with no
# store handle can never grow into a second query path around the
# store's own accessors, and it is testable with a handful of dicts
# instead of a database. tools/bm_view.py is the only caller, and it does
# the fetching through the store's own list_tasks, list_dependencies and
# list_evidence: no SQL and no second collector live here either.

# 13. EVERY REFUSAL, REWRITTEN
#
# L-S9. Keyed by the reason code a founder can meet, valued by
# (context, hint, next_action):
#
#   context      what was being attempted, in the founder's words
#   hint         the cause in plain language, never in the system's terms
#   next_action  one thing he can say or do
#
# TWO MODULES EMIT THOSE CODES, so two scanners enumerate them.
# tools/test_bm_visual.py reads bm_store.py's OwnershipRefused
# constructions and bm_controller.py's module-level UNATTENDED_ code
# constants, both with ast off the shipped source, and fails on any code
# with no entry here as well as on any entry here that neither module can
# emit. So this map cannot drift in either direction for either module,
# which is what makes L-S9 mechanical rather than aspirational.
#
# The controller half was added after its seven unattended refusals
# shipped rewritten in bm_controller.py but absent here, which is how
# `bm_view.py explain --reason unattended-fence-advisory` came to answer
# that it was not a reason this product emits.
#
# The wording follows references/terminology.md: your project's records
# rather than the store, your recorded approval rather than a receipt,
# task history rather than a work record, a catch-up rather than a
# briefing.
