"""BrotherMode public benchmark: 13 scenarios, run for real, against real stores.

WHAT THIS IS
  The thirteen scenarios ratified in
  docs/BrotherMode_V2_Post_Audit_Execution_Loops.md ("Public benchmark suite"),
  turned into something you can run. Every scenario builds its OWN throwaway
  git repository under a temporary directory, drives the real command line
  tools as a subprocess exactly as a user would, prints the commands it ran,
  what it expected, what it actually observed, and PASS or FAIL.

  It prints a score at the end. The score is the last line and the least
  interesting one: the inputs and the expected outputs are printed above it so
  that a reader who distrusts the score can re-run any single scenario by hand.
  Publishing only a number is exactly what this file exists to prevent.

WHAT IT IS NOT
  It is not the test suite. `python3 tools/test_all.py` is the test suite, it
  is far larger, and it is what the project gates on. This is the public,
  founder-legible demonstration that the thirteen claimed behaviours are real.

  It is not a performance benchmark. Nothing here is timed.

HONESTY RULES THIS FILE FOLLOWS
  - A scenario that cannot run on this machine prints SKIP with the reason. A
    SKIP is never counted as a PASS, and any SKIP makes the summary say so.
  - Observed output is quoted from the command, never paraphrased.
  - The exit code is 0 only when every scenario passed.

USAGE
  python3 scripts/benchmark.py            run all thirteen
  python3 scripts/benchmark.py 3 7        run only scenarios 3 and 7
  python3 scripts/benchmark.py --quiet    verdict lines only

Python 3.9, standard library only. It is under scripts/ and not under tools/
precisely because it uses subprocess: the shipping tools may not, and this
harness has to drive them the way a user does rather than importing them.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.
