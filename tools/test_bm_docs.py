"""Documentation consistency tests. Run: python3 tools/test_bm_docs.py

WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
  Loop 10 of the post-audit plan: active documentation kept carrying facts that
  had already moved. A quickstart told installers to expect a test count that
  was 90 tests out of date, and then told them a mismatch meant a broken
  install. Install pages listed four hooks while five shipped, so the fence,
  the one hook that can refuse a write, was off on every hand-wired install.
  A README declared a defect open that had been closed two days earlier.

  Every one of those was reproducible by reading a file, which means a test can
  catch it. This suite compares the pages against tools/bm_project_facts.py,
  which reads the facts out of the tree instead of out of someone's memory.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
  It does not require documentation to quote a test count correctly. It
  requires active pages not to quote one at all: counts move with every test
  that lands, and a page pinned to one trains readers to distrust the page.
  Exact counts stay in dated evidence (CHANGELOG.md, the dated files under
  docs/ and its subdirectories), which this suite treats as historical and
  leaves alone, checking only that they say so at the top.

Standard library only. Python 3.9. Reads files, writes none.
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.

    a released version.

    -design.md, section 7: every claim in the book must be true of the shipped
    code at the tag it documents.

    WHY THIS CLASS EXISTS
      An adversarial pass produced two readings of chapter six. One said the
      citation walkthrough was impossible against the shipped tool; running the
      tool against the file state the chapter itself displays reproduced every
      printed line, including the recorded hash prefix, so that reading was
      wrong. The other said the alert figure promised more than the guard
      delivers; running the guard confirmed it, because the guard is anchored and
      a re-captured correction carries a fresh anchor. Neither could be settled
      by reading the page. Both are settled here, through the real CLIs against
      a real store in a throwaway directory, so the page cannot drift back into
      either error unnoticed.

    A prose assertion in this class is not decoration. Each one pins a sentence
    that the tool behaviour in the same test just proved, so when the behaviour
    changes the failure lands on the page, which is the file that then has to be
    corrected.

#: reviewer's own words (docs/craft/FABLE-PRODUCT-CRAFT-RESEARCH-REVIEW.md
#: writes "BrotherModeUp itself has no frontend" and names BrotherME twice),
#: and editing a quotation of a reviewer is not a naming fix.
#: WIDENED 2026-08-05, and the narrower entry it replaces is the reason. The
#: list held docs/program/absolute-lead/EVIDENCE but not the program designs
#: that sit BESIDE it, so DESIGN-L04.md was read as a page a user lands on and
#: the naming rule fired on the repository slug in its own "Target tree:" line.
#: A design document is program record material of exactly the same class as
#: the evidence it produces: it states what was decided on a date, and
#: rewriting a name inside it falsifies that record. The whole
#: docs/program/absolute-lead tree therefore joins the list, which subsumes the
#: evidence entry, and docs/program/mirrorforge joins for the same reason (it
#: archives an outside program's own words plus the review of it).
#: Deliberately NOT docs/program as a whole: enumerating the subtrees keeps a
#: future user-facing page placed under docs/program covered by the rule
#: instead of silently exempt, which is the failure mode a blanket exemption
#: would create.

#: write fence, and both were fixed in prose rather than left excluded.
#:
#: docs/brotherme-explained.html presented the persona as the product (a title,

#: words are now BrotherMode, the three speaker labels stay BrotherME because
#: that is the persona speaking, and the paragraph above them introduces the
#: persona by name so the allowance below is earned rather than assumed.

    WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A REMINDER. The refresh procedure
    (docs/ECOSYSTEM-REFRESH.md) is a discipline, and the founder's standing law
    is that a rule no file enforces is written down as UNENFORCED or not
    written at all. This file is that enforcement.

    WHY THIRTY DAYS AND NOT SEVEN. The intended cadence is weekly, but a check
    that fails after one missed week is a tripwire: it turns every unrelated
    piece of work into a documentation errand and teaches people to bypass the
    suite. Thirty days means three missed refreshes before anything blocks,
    which is a real backstop rather than a nuisance. The number is a judgement,
    not a measurement, and it should move if the record shows it is wrong.

    a sandbox deny rule. Both were found by hand, on the way to a public
    release, which is the wrong way to find them.

    WHAT IS SCANNED, and what deliberately is not. The LIVE SURFACE is every
    tracked file except the dated material under docs/ and CHANGELOG.md. This
    suite already treats those as historical and leaves them alone, for the
    reason given at the top of this file, and the reason holds harder here:
    they quote verbatim command output, so rewriting them to look clean would
    falsify the evidence while removing nothing from a public clone, because
    the same bytes are in git history either way. Live code, scripts, config
    and root pages are different. They are read as instructions, they are
    copied by installers, and nothing about them needs an operator's name.

    THE VAULT RULE NAMES NO VAULT. Pinning the leaked name here would publish
    it again from the very check meant to retire it, so the rule is the shape
    instead: on the live surface a vault path is reached through
