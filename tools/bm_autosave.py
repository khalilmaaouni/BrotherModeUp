"""BrotherMode autosave (Phase 2, ratified design 2026-07-26): mechanical,
verifiable work-preservation. Replaces tools/bm_autosave.sh, removed in this
same change (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-phase2-recovery-design.md).

WHY THIS EXISTS
  Every "never lose work" rule in the constitution is PROSE the model must
  remember to run, at exactly the moment (running out of tokens, failing
  repeatedly) it is least able to remember anything. This module closes that
  hole mechanically: the harness fires it, not the model. Autosave is the
  component a founder reaches for when everything else has already gone
  wrong, which is why a backup that can silently be empty, or that deletes a
  file on restore, is worse than no backup: it replaces caution with false
  confidence. Seven such defects were reproduced by executing the V1 shell
  script (see the spec's table); this module closes all seven at once.

WHY PYTHON, NOT SHELL (deliberate, ratified)
  Windows support is ratified scope and shell scripts do not run there.

WHY SUBPROCESS IS ALLOWED IN THIS MODULE ONLY (deliberate, documented
exception, NOT a silent widening; tools/test_bm.py's no-network gate bans
`subprocess` in every other tools/*.py on purpose)
  git is the one external binary this project needs to snapshot a working
  tree, and there is no stdlib way to drive it. Every subprocess call in
  this file invokes `git` directly (argv list, never a shell string) with a
  fixed, reviewed argument shape; none of them is push, fetch, pull, clone,
  or remote, so the audited "no network, ever" property still holds: every
  call is local. SECURITY.md should record this same exception (out of this
  change's fence; flagged, not silently assumed).

WHAT CHANGED FROM V1 (closes FA, FC, FD, FE, FI, F2b, and the writer half
of J; see the spec for the full defect table)
  - One fixed ref (refs/brothermode/autosave) is now a NAMESPACE per
    worktree and per session, so linked worktrees of one repository can
    never overwrite each other's only backup (FA).
  - The temporary index is seeded from HEAD (`git read-tree HEAD`) before
    working-tree changes are staged, so a tracked file that secret-exclusion
    skips still carries its last committed content into the snapshot
    instead of vanishing (FC's root cause). Recovery never restores INTO the
    live working tree at all: it checks out the snapshot into a brand new
    `git worktree`, so the old delete-on-restore path cannot exist (FC).
  - A clean working tree (matches HEAD) clears this worktree's "latest"
    pointer instead of leaving it aimed at old, deliberately-discarded WIP
    (FD).
  - Every git call's return code is checked before its output is trusted; a
    failure aborts the whole snapshot BEFORE anything touches the existing
    latest pointer, and the universal empty-tree sha is refused explicitly
    as a second, independent guard (FE).
  - Every environment variable this module reads is parsed defensively:
    unset, zero, negative, non-numeric, and absurdly large all fall back to
    the default with one warning line, and every entrypoint exits 0 no
    matter what (FI).
  - `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` is resolved FIRST, and every git call
    after that runs with `-C <toplevel>`, so a snapshot triggered from a
    subdirectory still covers the whole repository instead of silently
    scoping the "." pathspec to that subdirectory (F2b).
  - A successful snapshot writes one row into the store's autosave_receipts
    table (schema shipped in Phase 1, tools/bm_store.py), giving a separate
    "is this actually saved" reader something true to check instead of
    assuming (the writer half of J; the reader half, the compact-hint
    consumer in tools/bm_telemetry.py, is a different fenced change).

NOTE ON worktree_id (a documented deviation from one literal phrasing in the
design draft, verified by direct execution rather than assumed)
  worktree_id is a short hash of THIS worktree's own resolved toplevel path,
  not of `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`. Common-dir was tried first and
  rejected: it resolves to the SAME shared main .git directory for every
  linked worktree of one repository (confirmed by running `git worktree add`
  and comparing --git-common-dir from both checkouts), so hashing it alone
  cannot be what distinguishes two worktrees, and using it as the sole input
  would reproduce FA rather than close it. The toplevel path is exactly what
  differs between two worktrees of the same repository, and it is stable for
  the life of that worktree, which is what a per-worktree ref namespace and
  "latest" pointer both need.

Python 3.9, standard library only (the one documented subprocess exception
above). No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or output.

# FINDING 16 (external audit, 2026-07-27): this used to be EXACTLY the ten
# globs inherited verbatim from the deleted V1 shell script, and enumeration
# alone was the whole boundary. Ten hand-listed shapes cannot enumerate the
# credential formats a real machine carries: id_ed25519 (the modern default
# ssh key, so the DEFAULT key type of every recent OpenSSH install walked
# straight into snapshots while the 2005-era id_rsa was blocked), .npmrc,
# .netrc, cloud credential files, kube configs, and service-account JSON
# were all captured. Autosaved content becomes a git object and can outlive
# ref deletion until garbage collection, so a miss here is not a near miss.
#
# The boundary is now three layers, not one:
#   1. git's OWN ignore status. `git add -A -- .` never stages a path that
#      .gitignore, .git/info/exclude, or the global excludesFile already
#      ignores, so every project's existing secret hygiene is inherited for
#      free. This layer was always true and never tested; it is pinned by a
#      test now, because an untested layer is an assumption.
#   2. The materially expanded default denylist below, pinned by
#      test_bm_autosave.py so it can never silently narrow again.
#   3. BROTHERMODE_AUTOSAVE_EXCLUDE, the founder's own additions, for the
#      shapes no list will ever enumerate (see _extra_exclude_pathspecs).
# On top of those, every snapshot WARNS with the untracked files it just
# captured (see _warn_new_untracked), so what entered a snapshot is visible
# at the moment it happens rather than discoverable afterward.
#
# Every entry below was verified by execution against a scratch repository
# holding one file of each shape (2026-07-27): the staged set was exactly
# the non-secret files, and the deliberately-kept cases (a source directory
# named credentials/, a file named config outside .ssh and .kube) stayed

# PURE git-ref reading (FINDING 1). No subprocess, deliberately.

# The consumer of the safety claim is tools/bm_telemetry.py's compact hint,

# subprocess (SECURITY.md's "no network calls" claim is gated by a test that
# bans the import, and the audited property is that the telemetry half shells
# out to nothing). If the re-resolution below ran `git rev-parse`, the hint
# would inherit a subprocess through this module and quietly break that
# property. So the ref is re-resolved by reading git's OWN ref storage: the
# loose ref file, then packed-refs, following a symref if it finds one.
#
# Why re-resolving the ref is enough to justify the claim: a ref is a
# garbage-collection ROOT. If the ref still resolves to the recorded commit,
# that commit and its whole tree are reachable and gc cannot drop them. If
# the ref is gone, the objects may be alive today and gone after the next

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The snapshot EVENT record (FINDING 1). One shot, present tense.
#
# THE DEFECT, exactly as the audit reproduced it: has_receipt() asked a
# HISTORICAL question ("did this session ever snapshot?"), and the compact
# hint printed "Your files are autosaved" from the answer. So:
#     10:00 snapshot succeeds, receipt written
#     10:30 more files change
#     11:00 the next PreCompact snapshot FAILS
#     11:05 the session resumes, a receipt for this session still exists
#           -> the tool says the files are autosaved. The newest work is not.
# A best-effort receipt deletion means a pruned snapshot could keep reporting
# safe for the same reason.
#
# The fix answers the PRESENT-TENSE question instead. Every snapshot attempt
# opens an event in state "pending" BEFORE it touches git, and only the
# publish path that has written the ref AND read it back marks it "saved".
# The hint consumes that event once and re-resolves the ref to the recorded
# sha before it will make any claim. A failed attempt therefore OVERWRITES
# the previous success, which is the whole point: the newest attempt is what
# the founder is being told about.
#
# WHAT THIS STILL CANNOT SEE, stated rather than papered over: files edited
# after the last successful snapshot, with no attempt since, leave the event
# "saved" and truthful about that snapshot. Nothing short of inspecting the
# working tree at hint time (a git call, banned in the hint) can catch that,
# so the verified message names the snapshot's own capture time and lets the
# founder judge, instead of implying "everything you have is safe".
#
# WHY A FILE AND NOT A ROW (a fence limit, reported rather than worked
# around): autosave_receipts (tools/bm_store.py, outside this change's
# fence) has no column for an event id, a ref name, or a success state, and
# every column is NOT NULL, so a "pending" row cannot be expressed there at
# all. A store may also legitimately not exist. The event therefore lives
# beside the refs it describes, in the git directory, and the store receipt
# is unchanged.

#
# I1's gate applies to every entry point below that can WRITE, enumerated
# here once so its scope is a decision, not an omission:
#   cmd_precompact  WRITES (a namespaced git ref, a commit, the event file,
#                   a receipt row). Fires AUTOMATICALLY from
#                   hooks/hooks.json's PreCompact entry, with no founder
#                   action in between. GATED on _consented(), first thing.
#   cmd_tick        WRITES the same way as cmd_precompact, PLUS its own tick
#                   counter file under the vault's telemetry directory, on
#                   every qualifying tool call once BROTHERMODE_AUTOSAVE is
#                   set. Also fires automatically (a PostToolUse hook, where
#                   wired), and setting an opt-in shell variable is not the
#                   same act as running scripts/setup.py. GATED on
#                   _consented(), checked BEFORE the opt-in check itself, so
#                   even the tick counter file never gets created
#                   pre-consent.
#   cmd_recover     Reads EXISTING snapshot refs and checks out a NEW git
#                   worktree OUTSIDE this repository's working tree (never
#                   touches the live tree; see BLOCKER 1 above); it creates
#                   no new project content. NOT gated: it is explicit and
#                   founder-invoked from a terminal, never fired by a hook.
#                   With cmd_precompact and cmd_tick both gated, any
#                   snapshot it could find either predates this fix or was
#                   made by a session that had already consented. Refusing
#                   to hand back a founder's own, already-saved work because
#                   consent was later withdrawn would be a second, unrelated
#                   defect: recovery is the one operation this module must
#                   never block on anything (requirement 6's own promise).

    the process umask (typically 0755 under the common 022 default)
    instead of 0700. On a shared machine with a world-writable temp
    directory, that made every recovered worktree, and any untracked
    private file inside it, readable by any local account (reproduced:
    drwxr-xr-x on the directory, -rw-r--r-- on an untracked secret file
