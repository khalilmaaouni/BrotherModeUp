"""Standalone validator for a change passport v1 document
(schema/change-passport.v1.json; docs/PASSPORT.md is the plain-language
guide; docs/NORTH-STAR-CHAIN.md, section "The change passport, in full", is
the spec authority).

WHY STANDALONE. A third party (BrotherSBE, a CI runner, anyone who never
installed this repository) needs to check a passport file without pulling in
this project's own tooling or a jsonschema library. So this file imports
NOTHING from this repository and NOTHING beyond the Python standard library.
It re-implements the handful of rules that actually matter by hand, rather
than deferring to the JSON Schema document, because a schema-only check
cannot express "field 4's items may be empty only when a justification is
given" without machinery this file is deliberately avoiding.

WHAT IT CHECKS, each one a NAMED reason on its own line when it fails:

  1. "schema" equals the literal string "change-passport/v1".
  2. The five consumer keys (whatWasDone, whoDidIt, whatWasRun,
     whatWasNotEstablished, whereItCameFrom) are present and ANSWERED: a
     non-empty list whose entries are non-blank strings. Matches the
     consuming side's own answered() (BrotherSBE tools/sbe_onepager.py):
     '' and None carry nothing, an empty list carries nothing.
  3. Field 4's law: details.notEstablished.items is non-empty, OR items is
     empty and details.notEstablished.noneClaimJustification is a non-blank
     string. A literal claim that nothing was left unestablished needs its
     own justification.
  4. change.baseCommit and change.headCommit are present and hex-shaped
     (7 to 40 hex characters); change.repo, change.projectId are non-blank
     strings; change.filesTouched is a list of strings (may be empty).
  5. details.who.accountableHuman is a non-blank string. Accountability is a
     name, never a role. details.who.sessions is a list of objects each
     carrying a non-blank "label" and a "claims" list of strings.
  6. Every entry in details.evidence carries an origin in {"local", "ci"}
     and a timestamp.
  7. generatedAt is a non-blank string shaped like the generator's own
     canonical form (seconds-precision UTC, a literal trailing "Z").
  8. details.method.name is a non-blank string.
  9. "sensitivity" equals "redacted" or "raw": the marker naming which
     export policy produced this document (cross-family review 2026-08-20,
     F1).
 10. CONSISTENCY: details.who.accountableHuman, when answered, appears
     (as a substring) in at least one whoDidIt line. whoDidIt is the only
     place the consumer ever reads the accountable name from, so a
     document whose two copies of that name disagree is not internally
     consistent, even though each one alone would pass rules 2 and 5.

Cross-family review 2026-08-20 (F7) found the standalone validator checking
only a subset of the schema's own required shape: a document missing
generatedAt, change.repo, change.filesTouched, details.method or a well
formed details.who.sessions passed with zero violations. Rules 4 (repo,
projectId, filesTouched), 5 (sessions), 7, 8, 9 and 10 above close that.

Exit codes: 0 and the line "VALID" when every check passes. 1 and one line
per violation when the document is well-formed JSON but fails a rule.
2 and one line naming the problem when the file cannot be read, is not
valid JSON, carries a duplicate object key, carries a non-finite numeric
constant (NaN/Infinity/-Infinity, which JSON does not define but Python's
json module accepts by default), or is over the 16 MiB size this validator
reads (F8: an unbounded read is an unbounded diagnostic surface for
whatever reads this file's own output next). A crash is never a pass: any
unexpected exception is caught and reported as a named error at exit 2.

Python 3.9, standard library only, no third-party schema library.
