"""BrotherMode documentation engine: the folder a stranger can read.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
  BrotherMode records more about a project than any document it produces. This
  writes the documents, almost entirely from what is already recorded, into a
  numbered folder whose reading order is unambiguous:

      Documentation/
        00-START-HERE.md
        10-business/     BA-SUMMARY REQUIREMENTS WBS SCHEDULE
        20-technical/    ARCHITECTURE DATA-MODEL PROCESS-DIAGRAMS
                         DEPENDENCIES CODE-MAP WHITEPAPER
        30-decisions/    INDEX.md and the D-<n>-<slug>.md packs
        40-handover/     HANDOVER.md RUNBOOK.md
        90-generated/    facts.json

  Phase B of docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-documentation-and-gate-packs
  -design.md, section 5.

THREE SOURCES, IN COST ORDER (section 5.2)
  PROJECTION, free. Store rows rendered directly: the work breakdown from work
  records and their claims, the schedule from records plus the dependency graph
  their overlapping claims imply (a mermaid gantt plus a critical path computed
  by longest path over that graph), the decision index from candidates, rules,
  receipts and recorded decisions, notes and lineage inline.

  INTROSPECTION, free. The repository and the store's own schema read as they
  are: a mermaid entity diagram built by introspecting sqlite, an import graph
  built by parsing the imports, a module inventory and a test inventory.

  NARRATIVE, last and least. Assembled from recorded fields, never invented, and
  cached against a hash of exactly those fields (I12), so unchanged facts do not
  regenerate a paragraph.

THE FOUR RULES THIS FILE LIVES BY
  I10, GENERATED OUTPUT NEVER DESTROYS HUMAN TEXT. Every document ends with a
  human block, and anything a human writes between the markers is carried
  through every regeneration byte for byte. The suite proves it with a
  deliberately destructive variant that must fail.

  I12, PROSE IS CACHED AGAINST FACTS. Every narrative block records the hash of
  the facts it describes. On regeneration a block whose hash still matches is
  reused verbatim and its writer is never called at all, which is what makes
  "unchanged facts do not regenerate" a measurable claim rather than a hope.

  I13, TIERS RAISE ONLY. The tier is chosen from measured signals, and the
  choice plus the signals that made it are printed and written into START-HERE.
  An automatic decision may only increase depth: the last tier is remembered in
  facts.json and acts as a floor. Lowering takes --tier, which is a founder
  saying so out loud.

  DETERMINISM. Two regenerations in a row are byte identical. No generation
  timestamp reaches a document body, every list is sorted, and every scan skips
  the Documentation folder itself, because a generator that reads its own output
  churns forever and every review then opens on a diff that means nothing.

WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DO
  It never writes the store: bm_store.py stays the single writer, and every file
  it produces goes through bm_store.write_generated_document, the one funnel that
  redacts before anything reaches disk and protects the human blocks. No network,
  no subprocess. It never imports the optional exporter (section 5.6): that lives
  in bm_docs_export.py with its own command, so the mandatory path cannot acquire
  an optional dependency by accident.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
  It writes no narrative the store did not record. Where a field is empty the
  document says the field is empty and names the command that would fill it. A
  generator that invents a rationale puts words in the founder's mouth.

  It quotes no candidate raw text. That is the most sensitive column in the
  store and it is withheld here exactly as `bm_learn.py show-candidate` withholds
  it.

Python 3.9, standard library only.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.

    """Everything that touched a decision, in order, with authors.

    A query, not a stored field (spec section 6). Every event carries the
    timestamp the store recorded and the author the store recorded, so a chain
    with no author reads as a chain with no author rather than as mine.

    THE JOIN USED TO MATCH NOTHING, and this is the defect phase C found by
    driving the real command line against a real store while the suite was
    green. Notes were grouped by the composite anchor STRING, whose key half is
    a full 32 character uuid, and compared against the eight character short id
    a document displays, so `("candidate", "1a2b3c4d")` was looked up in a map
    keyed by `("candidate", "1a2b3c4d5e6f...")` and no note ever joined any
    chain. The lineage section rendered the capture, the receipt and the rule and
    silently dropped every human word written about them, which is the one thing
    a lineage query exists to carry. Matching now happens on the raw anchor
    fields, and a fixture in the suite proves a note anchored to a candidate, to
    a work record and to a decision all reach the chain.

    A decision anchor is free text (a decision has no single column identity at
    schema 8: it is a record uuid plus a sequence number), so it is matched by
    PREFIX on the record uuid plus an exact sequence number. An author who types
    four characters where two records match will see the note in both chains.
    That is deliberate: the anchor as typed is printed beside the note, so an
    under-specified anchor is visible in the document rather than resolved by
    guesswork into one chain that may be the wrong one."""

    read accessor came back at 18 with a different md5, having failed to find
    what it was asked for.

    It is therefore declared ledger_write in tools/bm_effects.py, which is the
    true classification, not the flattering one.

    OPEN, and named rather than left implied: this command SHOULD be read-only,
    and it cannot be yet. Generator.__init__ calls store.note_anchor_reports(),
    and its row builders call store.list_learning_rules() and
    store.list_notes(). None of the three exists on bm_store.ReadOnlyStore, so
    swapping the constructor raises AttributeError on every normal invocation
    rather than only on the behind-schema case. Adding those three pure-read
    methods to ReadOnlyStore is what would close it, and that is a change to
    the store's own public surface, which deserves its own review rather than
    being smuggled in beside a docstring fix."""
