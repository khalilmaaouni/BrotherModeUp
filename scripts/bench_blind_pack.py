"""bench_blind_pack.py: the blind grading pack tool for the installed-arm
benchmark (design build step 6, docs/program/absolute-lead/
DESIGN-benchmark-installed-arm.md section 4.2 to 4.4 and section 5 step 6).

WHAT THIS IS
  Every place the benchmark cannot avoid a judgment call (T4 failure
  wording, H2 conflict-report wording, one comparison per repetition), a
  grader must never see which arm produced which output. This tool is what
  the harness itself uses to prepare that blind pack, replacing the manual
  X/Y shuffle-and-remember-the-mapping process that produced one label
  collision on 2026-08-07 (docs/BENCHMARK-COMPARATIVE.md, "Five
  repetitions per judgment cell": "one label collision caught and repaired
  before any grading began"). That collision is made structurally
  impossible here, not merely caught by a second look:

  1. LABEL ASSIGNMENT is deterministic from the comparison's own id (a hash
     of the id decides which candidate is X and which is Y), never a coin
     flip that could land differently on a rebuild of the same comparison.
  2. The ARM MAPPING (which label is really which arm) is written to a
     SEALED file whose filename IS its own content hash, so the file
     cannot be silently overwritten with different content under the same
     name, and a corrupted or hand-edited sealed file is self-evidently
     wrong the moment its name and its bytes disagree.
  3. Packing the SAME comparison id twice, or two comparisons in one batch
     that share an id, is a STRUCTURAL REFUSAL: nothing is written for
     either side of the collision, and the tool says why. This is the
     shape of mistake that produced the 2026-08-07 collision, so it is the
     one this tool is built to make impossible.
  4. The ONE-POINT MARGIN RULE (design section 4.3) lives here, not in the
     page that reports it: on the fifteen-point sheet, a margin of one
     point is NO DECISION; only a margin of two or more counts as a win.
  5. An OPTIONAL second grading pass through `codex exec` (design section
     4.4, the off-same-family bound) is wired but stays OFF unless a
     caller passes --codex-second-family explicitly and a rubric file. It
     is never reached by --self-test, which calls no network and no
     external binary at all.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
  It does not run the model cells (scripts/benchmark_comparative.py does),
  and it does not decide the rubric text (docs/BENCHMARK-COMPARATIVE.md
  freezes that, per the frozen-before-run law). It reads a rubric file only
  when asked to run the optional codex pass, and never writes one.

THE SEALED FILE, EXACTLY
  Canonical JSON, sorted keys, two fields only: comparison_id and the
  label-to-arm mapping ({"A": ..., "B": ...} are the only two arm names
  this project's harness ever compares). No timestamp is included in the
  hashed content on purpose: the hash is a pure function of
  (comparison_id, mapping), so rebuilding the identical comparison always
  produces the identical filename, which is what makes a REAL collision
  (the same filename appearing with DIFFERENT content) impossible short of
  a sha256 break, and what makes an ACCIDENTAL duplicate (the same
  comparison packed twice) visible as a plain "already sealed" refusal
  rather than a silent overwrite.

Python 3.9, standard library only. Runs a subprocess only for the optional
codex pass (--codex-second-family), gated behind an explicit flag,
never reached by --self-test. No em or en dashes anywhere in this file,
its comments, or its output.
