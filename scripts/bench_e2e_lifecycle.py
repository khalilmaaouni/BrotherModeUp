"""scripts/bench_e2e_lifecycle.py: the installed-plugin LIFECYCLE canary.

WHAT THIS IS
  FENCE V10 (BrotherModeUp-handovers/v3/WAVE-CD-BRIEFS.md), agent
  e2e-canary: the v3 gap-closure plan's Agent 7 mission ("End-to-End and
  Release Canary Engineer"), adapted to what exists tonight rather than
  built from zero. It extends scripts/benchmark_comparative.py's
  probe_installed canary (the install-the-shipped-way asserts, the
  BM_BENCH_AUTH_CONFIG persistent-auth law, the honest Skip discipline)
  from "one hook fired" into a full installed-plugin LIFECYCLE: a
  throwaway config first proves the migration story ruling B4 requires
  (V3-FREEZE-2026-08-07.md: a v2.1.1 install, uninstalled FIRST, before
  the v3 install, so the two plugins' hooks are never wired at the same
  time), then drives the deterministic public runtime boundary itself
  (tools/brothermode_cli.py: start, status, next, view, a REFUSED
  deliver, doctor), then uninstalls and proves the config carries no
  plugin remnant.

WHAT IT IS NOT
  Not a second probe_installed: this file drives NO live `claude -p`
  session. WAVE-CD-BRIEFS.md's FENCE V10 brief says so directly: "Live
  claude -p turns are NOT required beyond what probe_installed already
  proves; the lifecycle canary drives the CLI boundary and the plugin
  CLI, staying deterministic." Ruling H6 (V3-FREEZE-2026-08-07.md)
  already accepted the renamed probe_installed run as Wave A's live-hook
  proof; this file's job is the CLI boundary and the plugin CLI, nothing
  the hook itself already proved. Not a rewrite of
  tools/test_brothermode_cli.py's contract tests either: those pin
  behavior at the function-call level; this file proves the same
  boundary survives a REAL install/uninstall cycle and a REAL subprocess
  invocation, from a throwaway HOME nobody has touched before.

WHY THIS CANARY BUILDS ITS OWN THROWAWAY CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR RATHER THAN
REUSING BM_BENCH_AUTH_CONFIG (a deliberate deviation, stated plainly)
  probe_installed's persistent-auth folder exists for exactly one reason:
  a live `claude -p` session needs a real login, and a throwaway HOME
  cannot carry one (measured 2026-08-07, that function's own docstring).
  This canary drives no `claude -p` session at all, so no login is ever
  needed: `claude plugin marketplace add/install/uninstall/list/details`
  are local mechanics with no auth requirement at all (scripts/release-
  smoke-install.sh proves exactly this, daily, entirely inside a
  throwaway CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, no BM_BENCH_AUTH_CONFIG in sight, "No
  sign-in is needed: marketplace add and plugin install are local
  mechanics."). Reusing the persistent folder here would also be
  actively unsafe rather than merely unnecessary: this canary's own last
  act is UNINSTALLING the plugin and REMOVING its marketplace to prove
  the config comes back clean, and scripts/benchmark_comparative.py's
  arm B per-cell environment (protocol v2, _arm_b_environment) depends
  on that SAME persistent folder keeping the v3 plugin installed between
  cells for speed. Running this canary against that folder would tear
  down another canary's fixture out from under it mid-benchmark. Every
  directory this file builds is therefore its own fresh mkdtemp, deleted
  on exit, every run, matching the (simpler, unauthenticated) arm A
  posture rather than probe_installed's (authenticated) one.

THE EIGHTEEN STEPS, in order (STEP_NAMES below is the pinned contract;
tools/test_bm_e2e_pins.py asserts its exact content without running the
canary for real)
  1. confirm a claude binary exists at all (a missing one is SKIP)
  2. build a throwaway HOME, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and fixture directory
  3. clone the v2.1.1 tag into its own throwaway directory (the
     upgrade-leg baseline: a real historical release, not a synthetic
     fixture)
  4. install v2.1.1's plugin (brotherme@brotherme-marketplace) into the
     throwaway CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
  5. uninstall v2 FIRST (ruling B4's documented migration instruction:
     uninstall the v2 plugin and remove its marketplace BEFORE
     installing v3, so the two plugins' hooks are never both wired)
  6. install v3 (this tree) into the SAME CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR the shipped
     way, reusing scripts/benchmark_comparative.py's own
     _install_plugin_shipped_way so the two canaries can never install
     this tree two different ways
  7. verify the installed version and namespace: `claude plugin details
     brothermode` must name every one of the nine canonical public
     skills (V3-FREEZE-2026-08-07.md ruling B5; docs/brand/
     IDENTITY-CONTRACT.md section 8, "the nine v3 canonical skills")
  8. prove a single hook chain: `claude plugin list --json` names
     exactly ONE installed plugin (brothermode@brothermode-marketplace)
     after the migration, proving the uninstall-v2-first order actually
     prevents the double-hook-chain risk ruling B4 named, not merely
     asserts it in prose
  9. grant consent the shipped way (scripts/setup.py flag mode), exactly
     as probe_installed and scripts/rehearse_fresh_install.py already do
  10. initialize a throwaway project store in its own fixture directory
      (tools/bm_store.py init, fixture BUILD machinery, the same
      internal-adapter role probe_installed's own fixture builders play;
      not part of the measured boundary)
  11. drive tools/brothermode_cli.py start (creates the project row a
      task needs to reference before one can be seeded)
  12. seed one ready-state task (tools/bm_project.py task add, fixture
      build machinery, the same reason step 10 uses an internal tool)
  13. drive tools/brothermode_cli.py status
  14. drive tools/brothermode_cli.py next
  15. drive tools/brothermode_cli.py view
  16. drive tools/brothermode_cli.py deliver and prove it REFUSES: the
      seeded task never reached the terminal state 'closed', which is
      what incomplete evidence looks like at the deliver boundary
      (review is what would have supplied evidence and moved it there,
      and review is deliberately never called on this fixture)
  17. drive tools/brothermode_cli.py doctor (its own ten checks, read
      and printed verbatim; this canary does NOT require every doctor
      check to PASS here, since a throwaway plugin config is not a
      founder's live install and several checks are honestly expected to
      differ, for example the vault directory this canary never
      populates with a template; the thing being proven is that the CLI
      boundary reaches doctor and doctor returns a real, parseable
      verdict, not that the throwaway fixture is a healthy installation)
  18. uninstall v3 and remove its marketplace, then prove the config
      carries no remnant: `claude plugin list --json` is empty and
      settings.json's enabledPlugins and extraKnownMarketplaces are both
      empty

Exits 0 printing every step's verdict on a full pass. Exits 1 printing
"SKIP: <reason>" on the first move that cannot be proven here (a missing
claude binary, a failed install, an unexpected deliver acceptance, or any
other honest non-pass), the same Skip discipline probe_installed uses: a
SKIP is never a pass and never a silent success. A harness defect (an
unexpected exception) is also reported as SKIP, never as a crash with no
explanation.

USAGE
  python3 scripts/bench_e2e_lifecycle.py

Python 3.9, standard library only. Drives real `claude`, `git` and
`python3` subprocesses, which is why this lives under scripts/ and not
tools/, matching scripts/benchmark_comparative.py's own placement rule.
