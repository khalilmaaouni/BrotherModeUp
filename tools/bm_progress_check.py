"""Detect whether a project's progress page is missing or stale, mechanically.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  The founder's progress page (a Gantt-style HTML page) is how a
  non-engineer sees where a project stands. Sessions keep BUILDING it and
  then never SHOWING it, so the founder has to ask for it every time. This
  project's own founding law is that a rule written in a prompt is NOT a
  control; a control is a check that runs. This tool is that check: the
  mechanical half that detects and reports whether a page is owed. It does
  not build or show the page itself; a human or a model still does that.

THE CONTRACT
  A PLAN signals a project has committed to a shape of work. A PAGE is the
  progress view that shows the founder where that work stands. Both are
  detected purely by filename pattern, module level so an addition to
  either set shows up in a diff:

    PLAN_GLOBS  -- docs/plan/*PLAN*.md, docs/plan/*WBS*.md, PLAN.md (root)
    PAGE_GLOBS  -- docs/plan/*GANTT*.html, docs/plan/*BOARD*.html,
                   PROJECT-VIEW.html (root)

  Exactly four real verdicts, one line each, then exit:

    NO-PLAN        no plan signal found.                          exit 0
    CURRENT         a plan and a page exist; page mtime is newer
                    than the newest plan file's mtime.             exit 0
    OWED-MISSING    a plan exists, no page exists.                 exit 1
    OWED-STALE      a plan and a page exist, but the page is not
                    newer than the newest plan file.                exit 1
    NO-DATA         could not determine (for example the root
                    cannot be resolved). NEVER a pass.              exit 2

  Exit codes are load bearing: 0 nothing owed, 1 page owed, 2 could not
  tell. NO-DATA output always starts with the literal string "NO-DATA:".

EFFECT CLASS: pure_read
  This tool writes NOT ONE BYTE anywhere, ever: no file writes, no
  directories created, no store touched. It never constructs a writable
  bm_store.Store (doing so is itself a write: it probes the filesystem,
  edits git excludes, opens a WAL, and can migrate a schema). The answer
  comes from `glob` and `os.path.getmtime`, both read-only stat/list calls;
  bm_store is loaded only to borrow its `resolve_root()` for --root
  resolution, and is never asked to open a store.

BE SILENT-SAFE
  This runs at every session start. Any unexpected exception anywhere in
  this module is caught by `main` and reported as NO-DATA at exit 2,
  carrying the exception's type and message, rather than raising: a
  crashing check inside a SessionStart hook would break every session on
  this machine, not just this one check.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. No subprocess.
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.

Usage:
  python3 tools/bm_progress_check.py [status] [--root PATH]

`status` is the only verb and is also the default when no verb is given.
