"""Refuse the wall-clock stopwatch assertion pattern, by reading the AST.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  A test that asserts an absolute wall-clock duration (`assertLess(time.time()
  - started, 5.0)`) measures the MACHINE the suite happens to run on, not the
  code under test. It passes on a quiet laptop and fails on a busy one while
  the code has not changed at all. This exact defect has been found and fixed
  SEVEN times in ten days by seven different people in this repository. Review
  caught it seven times and prevented it zero times, because review runs
  after the code is written and a reviewer has to notice the shape by eye
  every single time. This tool is the machine that refuses the pattern before
  a human has to notice it again.

THE RULE
  Flag a comparison (`assertLess`, `assertLessEqual`, `assertTrue` with a
  comparison inside, or a bare `assert` with a comparison) where BOTH hold:

    1. one operand is a `BinOp` with `Sub`, where either side is a `Call` to
       `time.time`, `time.monotonic`, or `time.perf_counter` -- OR one
       operand is a `Name` whose most recent assignment in the SAME function
       scope has such a `BinOp(Sub, ...)` as its right hand side (the two
       line `elapsed = time.time() - start` idiom), AND
    2. the other operand is a numeric `Constant`.

  Condition 2 is what spares the approved fix shape: a ratio like
  `assertLess(large / small, 8.0)` puts the constant against a `BinOp(Div)`,
  never against a timing difference, so it is never flagged. `assertEqual`
  is never inspected at all, by name: a count check or a deterministic
  operation-count comparison is not this defect regardless of its operands.

  This is an AST check, not a regex, on purpose: a regex false-positives on
  every ratio assertion, every `assertLess(len(x), N)` count check, and every
  `assertLess(s.index(a), s.index(b))` ordering check, all of which are
  legitimate and appear in this repository today.

ESCAPE HATCHES
  ALLOWLIST_FILES and ALLOWLIST_DIR_PREFIXES below name real benchmark
  suites, exempt by path, visible here so an exemption shows up in a diff.
  A single line can also carry an inline exemption comment,
  `# walltime-lint: allow <reason>`; an empty reason is refused, meaning the
  line stays flagged, because a reason nobody typed is not a reason.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. No subprocess (this is a
shipping tool under tools/, and tools/test_bm.py bans that import here).
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.

Usage:
  python3 tools/bm_lint_walltime.py <path> [<path>...]

Walks directories for *.py files. Prints one line per violation as
"path:line: <the source line>". Exit 1 if any violation, exit 0 if none.
Exit 2, printing "NO-DATA: opened no files", if it opened zero files: a lint
that silently scanned nothing must never read as clean.
