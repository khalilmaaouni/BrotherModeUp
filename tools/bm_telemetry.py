"""BrotherMode telemetry: the mechanical half of the learning loop. Schema 2.

Subcommands:
  outcomes-append   SessionEnd hook target. Reads hook JSON on stdin, parses the
                    session transcript, appends ONE atomic JSONL line to the ledger
                    (schema 2: GenAI semconv token names) and scans the MAIN
                    transcript's short founder messages for correction candidates.
                    LOOP 3 WP-D (2026-08-01), consent gate: this now checks
                    scripts/setup.py's shared consent reader FIRST. Setup absent
                    or incomplete means it prints one sentence and returns having
                    appended nothing to the ledger or the corrections file; the
                    gate is the same one bm_sessionstart.sh checks before it
                    writes anything, so the two entry points can never disagree
                    on whether the founder has consented yet.
  migrate           One-time ledger migration to schema 2 (idempotent, temp+rename,
                    line-count recheck; never backfills absent values).
  scorecard         Renders the 9-metric dashboard from the ledger + companion files.
  rate              Records a founder felt-outcome rating. Integers 1-5 ONLY
                    (a human answering a 1-to-5 ask cannot produce a
                    fraction). --reply/--session name the PROVENANCE pair
                    (the founder's own verbatim words and the session id);
                    missing either records the rating but flags it
                    unattributed, reported separately and never averaged.
  rework            Records a REWORK signal: the founder sent a deliverable
                    back, or a later session redid the same artifact.
  escaped-defect    Records an ESCAPED DEFECT signal: a later session found
                    a defect in work an earlier session called green.
  review-mark       Records that a weekly review ran (feeds the overdue nag).
  startup-nags      One-line nags + yesterday's spend for SessionStart injection.
  stop-warn         Stop hook target, WARN ONLY (never blocks): systemMessage JSON
                    when a qualifying session has no vault session log today.
                    Cheap short-circuits only; never parses the transcript.
  registry-check    Flags fence-registry lines that look live in a stale file.
  fence-lint        Dispatch aid: prints live fences from the project's STATE.md
                    and the BROTHERMODE_REGISTRIES globs before a writer launches.
  prediction-audit  Counts sealed predictions in the founder model ledger and
                    reports alignment ONLY on the DIVERGED rows (prediction
                    and recommendation disagreed); agreement-case scoring
                    rewards flattery, so it is excluded, and a zero-diverged
                    week reports "0 scored divergent predictions" rather
                    than a ratio built on agreement.
  check-update      OFFLINE check of your installed copy: warns when an already
                    fetched update is waiting, when the copy has gone stale, and
                    once when the law itself changed under you. Reads git refs as
                    plain files: no network call, no subprocess, ever.
  intent            Write-ahead intent log. `intent "next: X, because Y"` appends
                    one line to a per-project log BEFORE a risky/long action, so a
                    death always leaves a forward-looking record (the write-ahead
                    log pattern: log the intent before the action, like a database).
                    The resume brief surfaces the last intent first.
  precompact-brief  PreCompact hook helper. Reads the hook JSON on stdin, extracts
                    the TAIL of the dying session's transcript (last instruction,
                    recent decisions, recent commands) and writes a resume brief to
                    the vault, so a resumed session recovers the THREAD, not just the
                    files the git autosave saved. Pure: reads/writes files only.
  compact-hint      SessionStart(source=compact) helper. Reads the hook JSON on
                    stdin; if the session just resumed from a compaction, checks
                    for a real autosave receipt (via bm_autosave.has_receipt)
                    before claiming safety, and prints the recovery command that
                    actually exists (bm_autosave.py, not the deleted .sh). Pure:
                    reads stdin and prints, no subprocess, no network.
  handoff           One shareable, SECRET-REDACTED markdown for handing a project
                    to a small team: overview + open items + latest session + recent
                    outcomes, assembled from the vault. Pure: reads vault files,
                    redacts, writes one file. No subprocess, no network.
  purge-corrections Deletes captured correction candidates (excerpts of your own
                    messages, secret-redacted and owner-only, but still yours to
                    delete). Shows the count first; --yes to confirm.
  speed             Wall-clock view for rubric metric 3: last 7d vs prior 7d,
                    span-hours per OUTCOMES line (labeled proxy, never invented).
  dedup             One-time cleanup of duplicate hook flushes (backup + count
                    check; keeps last flush per identical metric set).

Law: this tool NEVER blocks work. Every path exits 0. Numbers are parsed or
absent; nothing is invented. Token counts are labeled as-flushed (the transcript
may lag the final turn). Old (schema 1) and new lines are both readable: use
fld() everywhere.

    (subagent transcripts quote law text and would flood this). Nothing written
    here is a rule: the founder's review through bm_learn.py decides that, and
    no code path in this file can approve anything.

    Returns (found, dropped): found is how many candidates were actually
    appended (bounded by CORRECTION_CAP_PER_SESSION, the earliest distinct
    candidates win, unchanged behaviour); dropped is how many additional
    distinct candidates matched but did not fit under the cap (N-6 finding
    6, 2026-08-04: this used to be silently discarded with no count kept
    at all).

    Loop 4 (2026-07-29) closed docs/NOT-FINALIZED.md item 17. What changed, and
    why, because the old behaviour was MEASURED rather than guessed: the filter
    was one English regex with a hard 400-character cap, and of five real
    founder messages it captured two. A French correction and a 4,000-character
    correction were both dropped, and dropped SILENTLY. The founder works in
    French. So:
      - detection now runs bm_learning's English, French and Japanese phrase
        packs, and the old regex survives INSIDE the English pack rather than
        being replaced, so nothing that used to be captured stops being
        captured;
      - length no longer drops anything. A long message is EXCERPTED and the
        row records how many characters were omitted;
      - the per-session cap rose from 5 to 8, and each row records the language
        and the signals that matched, so a reviewer can see why it is there.

    Degraded path: if bm_learning cannot be loaded, this uses the old English
    regex and marks every row it writes `degraded: true` rather than pretending
    the packs ran. This module's law is that telemetry never blocks work, and
    the honest form of that is a labelled degradation, not a silent one.

    Transcript pairing: each row also carries a HASH of the assistant response
    the correction answers, a short redacted excerpt of it, and the artifact
    paths touched near it. The whole response is never persisted. The work
    record is not carried here (this module does not resolve one); outcome
    candidates carry the record, see bm_store.capture_outcome_candidate.

    Dedup guard (interim-score fix 2026-07-23): the SessionEnd hook can fire more
    than once per session; a (session_id, text) already in the file is never
    re-appended. The comparison is over NORMALIZED text (whitespace collapsed,
    NFC), because rows written before Loop 4 stored the message verbatim while
    the detector now stores a normalized excerpt: comparing the two raw forms
    re-appended every multi-line correction on the next flush."""

    real analysis work, out of scope for this mechanical pass), so it is
    invoked by whichever session or founder review notices the event.

    --record and --artifact are the LINK pair (Loop 8). A signal that names
    the work record and the artifact it is about can be joined to the rules
    that were applied in that work, which is what turns it from a tally into
    a grade. Both are optional and the signal is recorded either way, because
    an unlinkable outcome is still a real outcome; it is flagged linked=false
    so a report can list it separately instead of averaging it in. This file
    still writes only its own jsonl: attaching the event to rule applications
    is done by `bm_learn.py rework` and `bm_learn.py escaped-defect`, because

    tools/bm_autosave.sh, which Phase 2 deleted. Fixed then: the safety
    claim printed only when a receipt row existed for THIS worktree and
    THIS session.

    FINDING 1, external audit 2026-07-27: a receipt ROW was still the wrong
    thing to ask. It answered a historical question ("did this session ever
    snapshot?"), so this sequence printed a false all-clear:

        10:00  snapshot succeeds, receipt written
        10:30  more files change
        11:00  the next PreCompact snapshot FAILS
        11:05  session resumes, the 10:00 receipt still exists
               -> "Your files are autosaved". The newest work is NOT saved.

    This now asks bm_autosave.verify_recoverable, which consumes ONE
    compaction event (so a stale one cannot be re-read on a later resume)
    and RE-RESOLVES the recorded git ref to the recorded sha before any
    claim is made. Three outcomes, and the wording of each is deliberate:
      verified   name the ref and the short sha, and the time it captured,
                 so the claim says what it actually covers.
      unverified say plainly that the newest work may not be captured, and
                 give the exact command to check. Never softened.
      unknown    make no claim in either direction.

    Never runs git: bm_telemetry.py's HARD CONSTRAINT (see the "Update
    awareness" section above) is no subprocess, ever, so this resolves a
    project root the same file-only way bm_store.resolve_root does (walk up
    for .brothermode or .git) rather than calling bm_autosave.resolve_toplevel,
    which shells out to `git rev-parse`. In the overwhelmingly common case
    (no BROTHERMODE_ROOT override, no exotic marker placement) that root is
    identical to the git toplevel bm_autosave itself used when it wrote the
    receipt; on the rare path where the two diverge, the failure direction
    is a false "no receipt found" (never a false claim of safety), which is
    the safe side of this contract.

    Advisory only: bm_autosave missing, a failed root resolution, or any
    other exception here all degrade to an honest "not checked" message and
    this function never raises, so a resumed session is never blocked."""

# DELETED (fix-round 2026-07-26): `attribute <record_id> <output_tokens>` used
# to load bm_registry.py by path and accumulate spend onto d["records"][rid],
# a dict-shaped registry.json record. Phase 3 deleted bm_registry.py and
# rewired ownership onto bm_store.py's sqlite schema, which has no "spend"
# column or table at all, so the command had been silently no-op'ing behind
# its own bare except (confirmed: nothing in this repo calls `attribute`
# except historical design docs, and no test exercised its success path). A
# command that silently does nothing is worse than one that does not exist,
# and porting it forward would mean inventing a spend concept the store was
# never given, which is out of scope here. Deleted rather than repaired.
