"""Record time forecasts and actuals, and compute a correction factor from
real paired history, mechanically.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  On 2026-08-11 this project's overnight plan gave four time estimates.
  Three were judged and every one of them was wrong by four to five times
  in the SAME direction (the work finished far earlier than forecast). The
  one estimate derived from a previously measured run of the same command
  was accurate. Nothing in the system recorded forecast against actual, so
  the bias survived four estimates in one night and would have survived
  forever. The fix is not "estimate better": it is a tool that records
  forecasts, records actuals, computes the correction factor from real
  history, and REFUSES to invent a correction factor when history is too
  thin.

THE CONTRACT
  Storage: <root>/.brothermode/forecasts-log.jsonl, append-only, one JSON
  object per line, UTF-8, created on first write with mode 0600 inside the
  existing .brothermode directory. <root> is resolved by borrowing
  bm_store.resolve_root() the same way bm_progress_check.py does, with a
  --root PATH override, or --log PATH to point at a specific log file
  directly (what the tests use).

  Two record kinds, distinguished by the "kind" key:

    forecast: task, clock (agent|wall), basis (judged|measured),
              likely_minutes, plus optional upper_minutes, assumption,
              source, and recorded_at.
    actual:   task, minutes, plus optional note, and recorded_at.

  calibrate pairs every task that has at least one forecast AND at least
  one actual (matching --clock/--basis filters against the forecast side;
  actuals carry no clock or basis), using the LATEST forecast per task for
  a reforecast. ratio = latest_forecast.likely_minutes / actual.minutes. A
  pair whose actual is zero or negative is DROPPED and named, never
  silently included and never divided by zero.

  With fewer than 3 usable pairs, calibrate is NO-DATA at exit 2 and NEVER
  prints a multiplier: this is the load-bearing honesty property of the
  whole tool. It must never fall back to 1.0 and must never treat an empty
  log as a pass. apply runs calibrate internally and propagates its
  NO-DATA verbatim, printing no estimate, so a caller can never receive an
  uncalibrated number believing it was calibrated.

  check is the gate verb: a forecast open longer than --max-open-hours with
  no actual recorded against it is the exact failure that let the bias
  survive. An absent or empty log is NO-DATA, never PASS. A line that
  cannot be parsed as JSON is counted as malformed rather than crashing the
  tool; an all-malformed log is NO-DATA.

  Exit codes are load bearing everywhere: 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 could not tell.
  NO-DATA output always starts with the literal string "NO-DATA:".

EFFECT CLASS: append_only_log
  This tool owns exactly one file, forecasts-log.jsonl, and writes to it
  through one small helper, _append_record, which opens with
  os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT | os.O_APPEND at mode 0600. It never imports or
  constructs tools/bm_store.py's Store: bm_store is loaded only to borrow
  resolve_root() for --root resolution, exactly like bm_progress_check.py
  does, and this tool never becomes a second writer of the sqlite store.

BE SILENT-SAFE
  `main` catches every unexpected exception anywhere in this module and
  reports it as "NO-DATA: <ExceptionType>: <message>" at exit 2, rather
  than raising: a crashing check must never read as a pass.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. No subprocess.
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.
