"""Real subprocess measurement of what BrotherMode's hooks cost, for FENCE V7
(agent hook-performance, v3 gap-closure, WAVE-B-BRIEFS.md). Standard library
only. Run: python3 tools/test_bm_hookperf.py

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
  tools/bm_hookbench.py measures each hook PROGRAM in process, through
  runpy.run_path, because tools/test_bm.py bans `import subprocess` in every
  shipping module under tools/ (two named exceptions, neither this one), so
  that tool cannot fork a real process. It says so itself, twice: "Bare
  interpreter startup per hook process" and "The SessionStart hook" (a shell
  script it cannot execute in process at all) are both filed under its own
  NOT MEASURED section for exactly that reason.

  This file is a TEST file. tools/test_bm.py's own subprocess ban carries a
  standing exemption for test files (see that suite's
  test_no_network_claim_is_mechanically_true: "the test files themselves may
  import subprocess to drive the CLI they are testing"), so this file is
  free to spawn the REAL sh and python3 processes hooks/hooks.json actually
  wires: the fork, the exec, the interpreter bootstrap, and the shell
  wrapper's own cat/printf pipeline that bm_hookbench.py's in-process
  approach skips entirely. It fills bm_hookbench.py's two stated gaps with
  real numbers, and it is the measurement half of FENCE V7's mission:
  "measure the CURRENT per-event process fan-out first... repetitions and
  medians... never a single sample" (WAVE-B-BRIEFS.md).

WHY NO CONSOLIDATION WAS APPLIED TO hooks/hooks.json
  FENCE V7's mission also asks to "consolidate multi-process chains into one
  deterministic dispatch per event ONLY where behavior equivalence is
  provable." Investigation before writing any code here found that it is
  NOT provable within this fence's ownership (hooks/, plus this file, plus
  docs/evidence/v3/hook-performance.md; nothing else), because three
  currently green files this fence does not own hard pin the current
  multi-process shape:

  1. tools/test_bm_consent.py: TelemetryEveryHookProgramPreConsentCase
     declares MIN_WIRED_COMMAND_STRINGS = 7 and MIN_WIRED_PROGRAMS = 11 as
     floors, in its own words "raising a floor is the only direction this
     number is ever allowed to move." The live count of both, read fresh
     from hooks/hooks.json by TestBlockersAreReal below, is EXACTLY 7 and
     EXACTLY 11: zero headroom. Any hooks.json edit that removes or merges a
     wired python3/sh invocation drops one of these counts and fails that
     suite.
  2. tools/test_bm_hookbench.py: test_the_stop_event_chains_four_programs_
     under_one_shared_timeout asserts the Stop event wires at least 2
     programs, read fresh from hooks/hooks.json by its own parser (which
     only recognizes tools/ and scripts/ prefixed invocations, so a
     consolidating dispatch script placed anywhere, including inside
     hooks/, would not even register as a program and would fail this
     assertion at 0, not merely drop below the floor).
  3. The "four-copy law": scripts/install.py's hook_commands() function
     documents itself, in its own comments, as a hand-maintained duplicate
     of hooks/hooks.json's wiring that "must move in the same change", and
     tools/test_bm_docs.py::TestHandWiringBlocksMatchInstaller parses the
     hand-wiring JSON blocks in docs/QUICKSTART.md and docs/SETUP.md and
     compares them, command text included, against scripts/install.py's
     hook_groups(). None of those three files (install.py, QUICKSTART.md,
     SETUP.md) are in this fence's ownership, so a real wiring change here
     would leave them inconsistent with the documented invariant even where
     no single automated assertion goes red today.

  TestBlockersAreReal re-derives all three checks against the live files on
  every run, so this reasoning is verified mechanically rather than trusted
  as prose that can go stale.

WHAT "PROJECTED" MEANS IN THE RECORD BELOW
  Since no wiring change was safe to apply, this file cannot report a real
  measured "after". What it reports instead, clearly labeled and never
  conflated with a real measurement, is a PROJECTION: bare interpreter
  startup (measured for real, once, by this file) plus the sum of
  bm_hookbench.py's own already-validated per-program in-process medians
  for the programs in one chain, as an estimate of what ONE process paying
  the fork/exec/bootstrap cost once, instead of once per program, would
  cost. It is arithmetic over two separately and honestly measured
  quantities, not a real end-to-end measurement of a script that was ever
  written to hooks/ or run as a hook: no dispatch script was created here,
  because the three blockers above stood. The projection is conservative
  (a lower bound on the likely benefit): a real consolidated process could
  also share warm imports across its calls (bm_store.py alone is 17
  thousand lines per bm_hookbench.py's own docstring) and save more than
  this projection credits, but this file does not claim that saving,
  because nothing here actually shares those imports.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network (the one `claude --version`
probe is a local CLI call, not a network request, and is wrapped so a
missing binary degrades the field to null rather than failing the suite).
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.

# Projections. Every number that feeds a projection is measured the SAME

# of this file computed the projection from bm_hookbench.py's own in-process
# per-program medians instead, and it produced a projection LARGER than the
# real chain it was supposed to be smaller than. The cause was methodology,
# not noise (reproduced at 5 repetitions, spread factor under 1.05 on both
# sides): bm_hookbench.py's Sandbox sets `sys.dont_write_bytecode = True` so
# its own measurement never writes into this repository, which means every
# one of its in-process calls RECOMPILES from source, on every repetition,
# by design. A real `python3 tools/bm_telemetry.py` subprocess in a checkout
# that already has bytecode cached from earlier test runs pays no such
# compile cost. The two figures are both honest about what they measure, and
# neither is wrong, but they measure different regimes and are not
# addable. So this projection uses ONLY numbers measured the real-subprocess
# way, standalone timings of each individual program (bypassing the sh -c
# wrapper) taken in the SAME run as the chain they project against.
#
# Applied only at EVENT boundaries a real dispatch script could actually

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The projection formula, proven on FIXED inputs.
#
# "A projection never costs more than the real chain it projects from" is a
# property of the ARITHMETIC in projections(). It was asserted across two
# separately sampled measurement passes: measure_real() and
# measure_standalone_programs() are two runs, at two different moments, in
# two different Sandboxes, each taking a two-repetition median. That made it
# a property of the RUNNER instead. When the machine happens to be slower
# during the standalone pass than during the real pass, the projected sum
# legitimately exceeds the real median while the formula is perfectly
# correct, and the check goes red having found nothing.
#
# It did, on GitHub's macOS runners, on two unrelated pull requests, with
# different numbers each time (135.64 not <= 127.64 on PR 21; 164.82 not <=
# 152.08 on PR 25) while ubuntu passed both times. That is the same defect
# class as the doctor test fixed in PR 23, "the doctor test asserted a fact
# about the machine": an assertion about the environment wearing the clothes
# of an assertion about the code. See
# docs/evidence/2026-08-08-ci-red-doctor-forwarding-test.md.
#
# So the invariant is proven below against inputs this file fixes itself,
# built from the physical model the two passes are sampling:
#
#   standalone median of one program = bare startup + that program's work
#   real chain median of one event   = shell wrapper overhead
#                                      + sum over programs(bare startup + work)
#
# which is the whole of the old docstring's argument, made arithmetic. No
# clock is read and no process is spawned, so the answer is identical on
# every platform, under every load, in microseconds.
#
# The invariant is one-sided, so it cannot on its own see a formula that
# UNDER-collapses (a _project() that forgot to subtract the startups it
# stops paying still returns something smaller than the real chain). The
# second test therefore pins every published figure to the model exactly,
# which is where the sensitivity actually lives.
