# Run this repository's real gate locally and report the result to GitHub as a
# commit status. The sibling of the same script in BrotherSBE, deliberately.
#
# WHY. GitHub Actions is disabled across this estate by founder law of
# 2026-08-16, after an eleven job matrix across macOS and Windows consumed a
# free month of minutes in two weeks. The verification never needed a cloud.
# Only the REPORTING of it did. This runs the gate where it always ran and
# posts what it observed.
#
# THE GATE IS THIS PROJECT'S OWN, not a copy of one. CLAUDE.md documents
# `python3 tools/test_all.py` as the full battery, 8 to 13 minutes, and warns
# that backgrounding it as a harness task dies at exit 144 with no verdict.
# This script runs it in the foreground and waits, which is the shape that
# works.
#
# USAGE
#   scripts/local-gates.sh            run the gate, post the status
#   scripts/local-gates.sh --no-post  run the gate, report locally only
#
# EXIT 0 only when the battery itself exited 0 AND printed its ALL GREEN line.

# `os._exit(0)`, anywhere Python will import it from, makes every python3
# process exit 0 before running a line of the code under test. The measurement
# was zero bytes of output and exit 0 from a suite that normally prints and
# passes. Python imports sitecustomize and usercustomize automatically at
# startup, and a .pth file in a site directory executes any line beginning
# `import`, so all three are refused here rather than merely stripped from the
# environment: PYTHONPATH is stripped below, but a poison file sitting in the
# CHECKOUT ITSELF is on sys.path regardless of PYTHONPATH.

RECEIPT

# --- sign the receipt --------------------------------------------------------
# WHY A SIGNATURE AND NOT JUST A RECEIPT. Forging a green `local-gates` status
# needs only the GitHub token, whose scopes here are repo, workflow, gist and
# user: anyone holding it can POST success for any commit without running
# anything. The receipt above makes that visible by what it lacks, which is
# DETECTION. A signature is the second, different credential that makes the
# forgery hard: the private half lives only on this machine and is never a push
# credential, so a leaked token cannot produce one.
#
# Rejected alternative, deliberately: a git-notes receipt. Notes are just
# another push-scoped ref, forgeable by the same token that forges the status.
# That is ceremony, not identity.
#
# HONEST LIMIT, and it is a real one: a malicious process running as this user
# can read the key and sign. This defeats a leaked-token remote forger, not a
# compromised machine. Keeping the code under test away from the key is the
# sandbox's job, not this signature's.
#
# Failure to sign is NOT fatal and does not change the verdict: the battery
# result stands on its own, and a receipt without a signature is a weaker record
# rather than a wrong one. It says so out loud instead of failing silently.
