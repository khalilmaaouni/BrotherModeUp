"""Measure what BrotherMode's hooks cost, and generate docs/PERFORMANCE.md.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  An external review asked a question nobody in this project could answer: a
  normal shell call fires two hook programs before it and one after, and a Stop
  event chains four Python programs inside one shared timeout, and not one of
  those numbers had ever been measured. docs/HOOKS.md carried a single figure,
  "roughly 45 ms", with nothing behind it. So the operational cost of installing
  this product was unknown to the person installing it, which is exactly the
  class of unbacked claim the rest of this repository refuses.

  This tool answers what it can answer honestly and refuses the rest by name.
  docs/PERFORMANCE.md is GENERATED from a run of this file. Every number on that
  page comes out of a measurement here, and the page carries the machine record
  it was taken on, because a latency number without a machine is a rumour.

WHAT IT MEASURES
  1. WHAT ACTUALLY RUNS, read from hooks/hooks.json rather than typed: which
     programs fire at which event, in which order, with which arguments, under
     which shared timeout. If the manifest changes, this page changes with it.
  2. THE COST OF EACH PROGRAM, separately from THE COST OF THE CHAIN. Those are
     two different numbers and the Stop event is why: four programs share one
     30 second budget there, so a per program figure alone would understate what
     the founder waits for.
  3. HOW OFTEN A PROGRAM FAILS OR FAILS OPEN under the benchmark's own
     conditions, counted from real exit codes and real stderr, never assumed.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO MEASURE, AND WHY THAT MATTERS MORE THAN ANOTHER NUMBER
  See NOT_MEASURED below. Every entry is a question the review asked that this
  project has no honest way to answer today: the share of real sessions hitting
  a warning or a false refusal needs field data nobody collects, and lock
  contention frequency in real use needs concurrent real sessions, not a
  laboratory. A number invented for those would be worse than the silence the
  review complained about, so they are printed as NOT MEASURED with the reason.

WHY IT DOES NOT SPAWN PROCESSES, AND WHAT THAT COSTS THE ANSWER
  tools/test_bm.py forbids `import subprocess` in every shipping module under
  tools/, and its allowlist names exactly two files, bm_autosave.py and
  bm_controller.py. This file is not one of them and does not add itself to a
  list it does not own. So it runs each hook program IN PROCESS, through
  runpy.run_path with run_name "__main__", after purging sys.modules of
  everything the previous run imported, so every repetition pays a cold import
  the way a fresh hook process does. What that captures: compiling the program,
  cold importing its dependencies (tools/bm_store.py is 17 thousand lines and is
  the bulk of it), reading the payload off stdin, and the whole decision.

  What it does NOT capture, stated here and on the page rather than buried: the
  fork, the exec, and the CPython interpreter bootstrap that a real hook pays
  once per process, before any of this code runs. That residue is a constant per
  process, this file cannot measure it without the subprocess call it is not
  allowed to make, and it is therefore reported as NOT MEASURED with the command
  a reader can run to get it on their own machine. Every per action total on the
  page is a measured LOWER BOUND for that reason, and says so.

THE THROWAWAY WORLD
  Every measurement runs against a store created for the run in a temporary
  directory, with HOME, the setup config path, the vault path and the project
  root all pinned inside it, and the process working directory moved there. The
  founder's own store, vault and home are never read or written. The only file
  this tool writes outside that temporary directory is the page itself.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. No subprocess.
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.

Usage:
  python3 tools/bm_hookbench.py                  # measure, rewrite the page
  python3 tools/bm_hookbench.py --reps 25        # more repetitions
  python3 tools/bm_hookbench.py --json           # the record on stdout, no write
  python3 tools/bm_hookbench.py --out PATH       # write somewhere else
  python3 tools/bm_hookbench.py --compare P.json # re-measure, check the band
