"""BrotherMode correction learning: the founder's command line.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
  You correct me. That correction should survive the session, apply when it is
  relevant, and never change my behaviour until YOU said so. This command line
  is the only path from "you said something" to "it is a rule", and every step
  of it is yours.

THE FIVE SEPARATE QUESTIONS, KEPT SEPARATE ON PURPOSE
  Most systems collapse these into one claim that the assistant "learned":
    1. capture       did you correct me, and what exactly did you say
    2. interpretation what narrow trigger and action does that evidence support
    3. approval      did you approve that interpretation as a rule
    4. application   was the rule retrieved and followed when it mattered
    5. outcome       did following it help
  This tool keeps them auditable, so "it learned" is never a claim you have to
  take on trust.

WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DO
  It never writes the database directly. Every mutation goes through
  bm_store.py, which stays the single writer. It performs no network access and
  spawns no subprocess.

APPROVAL NEEDS A RECEIPT FROM A REAL ANSWER OF YOURS
  There is no --auto, no daemon, and no hook that can approve anything, and
  since 2026-07-29 that is mechanical rather than a promise. Approval takes two
  steps:

    1. You are asked a question about one candidate. Whoever asked runs
       `grant-approval <candidate> --answer "<what you said>"`, which prints a
       one-time token, good for fifteen minutes, for that candidate only, and
       tied to the exact rule text you were shown.
    2. `approve <candidate> --receipt <token>` spends it. Once.

  Change the candidate or the rule text after the question and the token dies.
  Use it twice and the second try refuses. There is no override and no
  break-glass: without a token, no rule is created.

  WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. Nothing here authenticates WHICH human answered.
  The token proves an answer was given about this exact thing and has not been
  spent; it does not prove your identity, and no wording in this product says
  it does. What it removes is the real hole: before this, any process that
  could run this file could manufacture an approved rule, and the reference it
  recorded said "run by the founder" whether or not anyone was there.

RETRIEVAL MODE: deterministic lexical matching by default, and that path is
complete on its own. An OPTIONAL SQLite FTS5 index can be turned on with
BROTHERMODE_FTS5=1, which adds stemmed matching and a BM25 component to the
ranking; BROTHERMODE_NO_FTS5=1 forces it back off and wins over the first. Every
retrieval prints the mode it actually used, and no output claims BM25 unless a
real index answered. See `index-status` and `rebuild-index`.

TWO RETRIEVAL VERBS, NOT ONE VERB AND A FLAG
  `lookup` reads and writes nothing. `apply` retrieves AND records that the
  rules were surfaced, requires --session, and exits 3 with a PARTIAL status
  if the recording fails. Substantial work uses `apply`. The old `relevant`
  survives as a deprecated alias that says so on every run, because recording
  behind an opt-in flag meant one forgotten flag left no trace at all.

Python 3.9, standard library only.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.

      looks identical and the application rows simply never exist. So the

        apply   always attempts to record, and refuses without --session,

                tied back to the work it belongs to.
