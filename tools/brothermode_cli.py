"""tools/brothermode_cli.py: the one deterministic public runtime boundary
(V3-FREEZE-2026-08-07.md answer 4; plan section "Agent 4, Runtime Boundary
Engineer", ~/Downloads/BrotherMode_v3_Gap_Closure_Execution_Plan.md).

WHAT THIS IS
  A THIN DISPATCH layer over the internal adapters BrotherMode already
  ships: tools/bm_project.py (start, next, review, deliver), tools/
  bm_lead.py (status), tools/bm_view.py (view), scripts/doctor.py
  (doctor), tools/bm_autosave.py (recover), and tools/bm_project_facts.py
  plus scripts/install.py (version, update). Every pass-through
  subcommand below calls the SAME function the matching internal tool's
  own CLI already calls, in process, with the SAME argv. Its output is
  not a re-description of that tool's behavior, it is that tool's
  behavior: tools/test_brothermode_cli.py's load-bearing test proves this
  for `status` by running both binaries as real subprocesses and diffing
  their stdout byte for byte.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  Freeze answer 4: "Single public runtime boundary: the brothermode CLI
  (start, status, next, review, deliver, view, doctor, recover, version,
  update). Skills call ONLY it. tools/bm_*.py become internal adapters
  behind it." The architecture refutation's H4 named the risk directly:
  a boundary that exists in name only, with the seventeen bm-* console
  scripts still public and every skill still calling tools/bm_project.py
  by path, is not a boundary, it is a rule nobody can check. This file
  is Agent 4's answer: ONE file a skill (or a founder) can call, thin
  enough that reading it end to end proves it duplicates nothing.

SUBCOMMANDS
  start     tools/bm_project.py start (project creation)
  status    tools/bm_lead.py status (the founder's eight-field view;
            THE load-bearing byte-identity contract lives on this verb)
  next      tools/bm_project.py next (the one recommended next task)
  review    tools/bm_project.py review (evidence + transition, one call)
  deliver   tools/bm_project.py deliver (the delivery packet)
  view      tools/bm_view.py render (the generated project-view page;
            NON-AUTHORITATIVE, a render, never a source of truth,
            freeze answer 3)
  doctor    scripts/doctor.py (the ten install-health checks)
  recover   tools/bm_autosave.py's real recovery read path; per
            V3-FREEZE-2026-08-07.md's Refutation adjudication ruling B1,
            recovery here means COMPACT-BOUNDARY autosave snapshots
            ONLY (a kill -9, a crashed terminal, an OOM, or Ctrl-C
            before the next compaction leaves nothing to recover), and
            this subcommand says so out loud every time, not only when
            material happens to be absent
  version   the VERSION file's content, read through scripts/install.py
            read_version, the same reader install.py itself uses to
            report what it just installed
  continue  tools/bm_continue.py continue (the handoff packet
            generated from store rows, plus the successor launch;
            --dry-run writes the packet, prints the command, and
            launches nothing)
  update    a read-only report: the installed version against the
            newest published release tag, and the exact steps for the
            caller's own install path (commands/brotherme-update.md's
            own steps 1 through 6, automated as a lookup, never as an
            action: this subcommand runs no git command that writes
            anything and issues no /plugin command itself)

HARD RULES THIS FILE OBEYS (plan, Agent 4)
  1. Contract tests were written FIRST: tools/test_brothermode_cli.py
     existed, and its tests were run failing, before this file's first
     working subcommand.
  2. The store is never rewritten here. No new table, column, or query
     is introduced anywhere in this file: every subcommand either calls
     an internal tool's own command function directly, or reads a
     single already-published fact (VERSION, or bm_project_facts.facts)
     the same way an existing tool already does.
  3. No domain logic is duplicated. The only arithmetic this file adds
     that no internal tool already exposes as a callable is `update`'s
     release-tag comparison (_version_key, _parse_ls_remote_tags,
     _fetch_remote_tags below); everything else `update` prints is
     read straight from tools/bm_project_facts.py's own facts().
  4. Every generated view (CANVAS.md, DELIVERY-PACKET.md, the project
     view page, the recovery worktree) stays a render or a read: this
     file writes none of them directly, it only reaches the internal
     tool that already owns the write.
  5. Skills are expected to call ONLY this boundary from here forward;
     this file is what makes that instruction checkable rather than a
     wish (refutation H4).
  6. tools/bm_*.py and scripts/*.py stay the adapters; this run does not
     remove or hide them (ruling H4: "the 17 console scripts stay as
     internal adapters this run, documented as such; removal is
     post-v3").
  7. No new capability: every subcommand is a Python-level call to code
     that already ships, or, for `update`, a read-only report built
     from facts other tools already compute plus one read-only network
     read (`git ls-remote --tags`, never a write).

WHAT THIS IS NOT
  Not a second store, not a second writer, not a second definition of
  what "recovered" or "up to date" means: every fact this file states
  about the store's contents comes from calling the tool that already
  owns that fact, never from a query written here. Not a place that
  performs an update: cmd_update prints the exact commands
  commands/brotherme-update.md already documents and executes none of
  them, matching this run's "no git commands that write" constraint.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No em or en dashes anywhere in this
file, its comments, or its output.
