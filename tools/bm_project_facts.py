"""Print the project facts that documentation is allowed to state, as JSON.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  Documentation kept carrying facts that had already moved: a test count from
  three loops ago, a hook count from before the fence hook was wired, a release
  tag from the previous candidate. Every one of those numbers already exists
  somewhere in the code or in a one-line file. This tool reads them from there,
  so a page can be checked against the tree instead of against someone's memory.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT PRINT
  A total test count. It changes on every test that lands, which makes every
  page that quotes it wrong within a day, and a reader who sees a mismatch
  cannot tell a stale page from a broken install. The gate command and its
  expected verdict are printed instead: run it, expect ALL GREEN. Exact counts
  belong in dated release evidence (CHANGELOG.md, the dated baseline files),
  where the date says what the number was true of.

WHERE EACH FACT COMES FROM
  version, is_development,
  release_tag                 VERSION (one line)
  schema_version              tools/bm_store.py, SCHEMA_VERSION
  test_suites, suite files    tools/test_all.py, the SUITES tuple
  hook_events, hook_count     scripts/install.py, HOOK_EVENTS
  supported_python_floor      scripts/install.py, its version_info guard
  retrieval_modes             probed in tools/bm_store.py and tools/bm_learning.py
  default_branch              declared below; git cannot be asked without a
                              subprocess, and shipping tools run none
  repo_url, primary_skill_dir,
  dev_skill_dir                declared below, for the same reason
                                default_branch is: no subprocess
  install_command_plugin       plugin id and marketplace id read from
                                product.identity.json, the owner/name of the
                                marketplace source derived from REPO_URL, and
                                the ref it is pinned to from install_target_tag.
                                Nothing about it is typed twice: this field
                                spent a release naming the pre-v3 ids
                                (brotherme@brotherme-marketplace) because it
                                held its own copy of them
  install_command_pinned,      computed from install_target_tag
  install_command_dev          (PUBLIC_INSTALL_TAG below), never from
                                release_tag: a development identity's
                                release_tag would name a tag that must never
                                exist, so the pinned install command is built
                                from the tag known to actually resolve in
                                git instead. An onboarding page states this
                                command by copying what this tool prints,
                                never by typing a tag from memory, and
                                tools/test_bm_docs.py fails a page that
                                disagrees with it
  is_development                true when version contains ".dev"
  install_target_tag           PUBLIC_INSTALL_TAG below; see docs/RELEASE.md,
                                "The version law"
