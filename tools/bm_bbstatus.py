"""Host-aware gate reporting for scripts/local-gates.sh.

WHY THIS EXISTS (two-host law, founder order 2026-08-16). The local gate
runner posts its verdict as a commit status, and until this tool existed the
posting arm was `gh api` with a hardcoded GitHub repository: correct on the
canonical checkout, and a guaranteed reporting failure, exit 2, for anyone
whose origin lives on Bitbucket Cloud or anywhere else, even though their
battery had just passed. The engine never talks to a host API; the gate
RUNNER may, because reporting a verdict is the runner's work, not the code
under test's. This file is that reporting arm for the non-GitHub half.

WHAT IT PROMISES, and scripts/local-gates.sh holds the other half:

  1. `classify` reads a git remote URL and answers github, bitbucket, or
     unknown, so the runner can route. Classification is pure string
     parsing: no git, no network, exit 0 always.
  2. `post` sends one Bitbucket Cloud build status for a commit. A failure
     to post prints WHY and exits nonzero, and the runner's Bitbucket arm
     deliberately does not let that change the gate's own exit status: a
     verdict that could not be REPORTED is still the verdict. The GitHub
     arm keeps its historical behavior byte for byte, including exit 2 on
     a failed POST, because sessions on the canonical checkout already
     treat that exit as load-bearing.
  3. On an unknown host nothing is posted and the runner says so. NO-DATA
     is never silent.
  4. The credential never reaches a returned or printed message. `_scrub`
     replaces it with `<redacted>` in every message `post_status` returns,
     including the HTTPError and URLError branches, which carry text this
     module did not compose and cannot fully predict.

CREDENTIALS, from the environment only, never from a file in this
repository (CLAUDE.md credential rules). Two shapes, tried in this order:

  BITBUCKET_TOKEN                          sent as a Bearer token (a
                                           workspace, project or repository
                                           access token).
  BITBUCKET_USERNAME and
  BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD                   sent as HTTP Basic. Atlassian
                                           retired classic app passwords on
                                           2026-07-28 (docs/BITBUCKET.md);
                                           the SAME variable now carries a
                                           scoped API token, and the name is
                                           kept because both siblings in
                                           this estate use these exact
                                           names, which is the parity the
                                           founder asked for.

The urllib import below is a NAMED exception in tools/test_bm.py's
zero-network suite, per file and per module, the same way bm_autosave.py's
subprocess import is: this tool is invoked by scripts/local-gates.sh after
a battery completes, never by a hook, and the one request it makes is the
status POST it exists for. SECURITY.md documents it beside the other named
exceptions.

file, its comments, or its output.
