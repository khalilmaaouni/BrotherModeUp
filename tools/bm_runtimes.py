"""BrotherMode cross-runtime adapters: emit per-runtime instruction files.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  BrotherMode's engine is a handful of Python files driven from a shell. Nothing
  in bm_store.py, bm_threads.py, bm_learn.py or bm_telemetry.py is specific to
  Claude Code. What IS specific to Claude Code is the wiring: the hooks, and the
  file the runtime reads to learn the law. Every other coding runtime has its own
  instruction file convention and its own hook story, and a founder who works in
  two runtimes should not have to hand transcribe the law into each one and then
  watch the copies drift.

  So this file generates them. One registry of runtimes, one renderer, one
  command. Regenerating is cheap, which is the point: a generated file that
  drifts is a bug the gate catches, a hand written one is a bug nobody sees.

WHAT THIS FILE REFUSES TO DO
  It does not guess. Every destination path in the registry below was read off
  the runtime vendor's own documentation page on the date recorded beside it, and
  the URL travels with the fact: into the generated file's header, and into
  docs/RUNTIMES.md. A convention that could not be verified ships marked GENERIC
  with the reason attached, rather than shipping as a confident path that sends
  the founder's law into a file nothing reads.

  It also does not overwrite anything the founder owns. Emission writes into a
  STAGING directory (docs/runtimes by default, which is COMMITTED on purpose so
  the adapter files are readable on the repository page) plus the capability
  table, and prints an install map. AGENTS.md at a repository root is frequently
  a file with real content in it already; a generator that clobbers it would be
  worse than no generator. Every target is checked before anything is written:
  a file that exists and does NOT carry this generator's marker line is treated
  as founder owned, and the whole emit refuses rather than writing part of it.
  --out moves the capability table too, so a redirected emit touches nothing
  outside the directory the founder named.

THE HONEST LIMIT, STATED ONCE HERE AND AGAIN IN EVERY FILE IT WRITES
  Two different questions get confused constantly, so they are kept apart:
    1. does this runtime have hook points at all
    2. do BROTHERMODE's hooks run there
  Question 1 has a verified answer per runtime. Question 2 has exactly one
  verified yes, Claude Code, because bm_fence_hook.py and bm_telemetry.py's hook
  targets parse Claude Code's hook JSON contract (documented in docs/HOOKS.md).
  Another runtime having a PreToolUse event does NOT mean it hands that event the
  same JSON shape. Until somebody runs the adapter against the real runtime and
  records the payload, the correct entry is "hook points exist, BrotherMode hook
  compatibility unverified", and that is what the table says.

  One runtime has now been measured rather than assumed: OpenAI Codex CLI, on
  2026-08-05, on codex-cli 0.146.0. The measured answer is a NO, not a yes and
  not an unknown: Codex reports every file write as tool_name Bash running
  apply_patch, so BrotherMode's Edit/Write matcher never fires. A registry entry
  carrying a `measured` block replaces UNVERIFIED with what was observed, in
  both directions, because UNVERIFIED reads as "might work".

  The retrieval and store commands are NOT the opposite case, which is the
  mistake this file used to ship. They are ordinary processes, so the CODE is
  runtime neutral; the EXPERIENCE is not. They live in the BrotherMode checkout,
  so a project that is not the checkout must call them by absolute path, and a
  runtime that sandboxes its shell read-only cannot create the store at all.
  Both failures were measured under Codex on 2026-08-05, and both are now stated
  in every file this generator writes.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network, no subprocess. The verification
this file's registry depends on happened OUT OF BAND, by a human or an agent
opening the vendor page and recording the URL and the date; this module never
fetches anything at runtime, and it never could.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.
