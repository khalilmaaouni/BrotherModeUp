"""Enumerate what capability is installed on this machine, mechanically.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  BrotherMode's Toolkit is a capability BROKER, not a marketplace (see
  docs/plan/TOOLKIT-PLAN-2026-08-12.md section 3, function F1). No command
  today answers "what capability is installed on this machine" across
  plugins, skills, hooks, settings layers and MCP servers at once. Claude
  Code enumerates plugins one at a time (`claude plugin details`) but never
  aggregates across them, and never covers skills, settings layers or CLIs.
  This tool is that aggregation, read straight from artifacts: plugin
  manifests, hooks.json files, settings.json, the skills directory, and
  .claude.json. What a tool registers is observable without running it.

THE CONTRACT
  Five verbs. `inventory` (human readable, the default) and `json` (one
  JSON object, schema 1, for later loops such as conflict detection to
  consume rather than re-parse). See the top-level JSON shape in the plan
  brief; `build_inventory()` below is the single place that shape is built.
  `conflicts` (human readable) reads that same inventory plus a table of
  conflict classes and emits verdicts, per docs/plan/TOOLKIT-PLAN-2026-08-12.md
  section F2. `capabilities` (human readable) reads that same inventory and
  emits capability records, per section F3 and section 4 below. `route`
  (human readable) reads that same inventory plus a routing table and names
  the capability a task class should use, per section F3 below.

ROUTING (F3, section 3 of the plan)
  `route <task-class>` answers "which existing capability should do this
  task", never which team member should do it (that is delegation, a
  separate ladder, and routing composes with it rather than replacing it).
  The table is DATA, not prose: ROUTES below is the module constant the
  founder's own six examples are seeded into (decision 34's pattern,
  identical in shape to DEFAULT_CONFLICT_CLASSES): TDD to Superpowers,
  product strategy to Compound Engineering or BMAD, long phase planning to
  a GSD-class capability, security check to Security Guidance, PR review to
  Anthropic Code Review, historical recall to a claude-mem-class capability.
  tools/toolkit_routes.json next to this file ships as a founder-editable
  copy of that same table; present and valid it REPLACES the defaults
  entirely, present and malformed it is refused BY NAME and the run falls
  back to the shipped defaults, absent it is silence, never an error, the
  same three-way contract load_conflict_classes already uses.

  A task class carries one or more routes, tried in the order listed. Each
  route names a `capability`, the `reason` it was chosen, its
  `flip_condition` (what would change the choice), a `degrade_path` (what
  to do when the capability is absent from THIS machine), and `enabled`.
  A route with `enabled: false` is never silently hidden: the command
  prints it under its own DISABLED status carrying its `disabled_reason`,
  same visibility discipline as a HAND-ASSERTED capability record. The
  BMAD route ships DISABLED with reason "on-disk footprint unconfirmed"
  (section 5b of the plan) until somebody confirms it against a real
  repository tree; that is a decision recorded in data, not commented out.

  Presence is checked against `build_inventory()`, the exact same artifact
  read every other verb uses, via each route's `match` ({"kind": "plugin"
  or "skill" or "mcp_server", "name": "..."}); nothing here runs the
  capability or asks it anything. A capability present in the inventory
  resolves the route and prints its reason. A capability absent from the
  inventory prints its `degrade_path` instead of guessing a substitute.
  When the whole inventory could not be read, `route` reports NO-DATA at
  exit 2, the same as every other verb: an absent capability is a real
  answer, an unreadable inventory is not one. A task class this table does
  not carry is refused BY NAME, listing every known class, never guessed
  and never silently routed to the nearest string.

CAPABILITY RECORDS (F3, section 4 of the plan)
  A capability record's reach is DECLARED, never measured by running
  anything: it is read from the same artifacts `build_inventory()` already
  parses (a plugin manifest, its hooks.json, a skill's hooks.json, the
  mcpServers key of .claude.json). Every DERIVED record names the exact
  artifact paths it was built from in its `source_files` list, which is
  never empty: the capability's own directory is always the first entry,
  because a directory existing is itself an artifact, and the manifest or
  hooks.json paths are appended when they were actually read.

  A record can also be HAND-ASSERTED: typed by a human into an optional
  override file (tools/toolkit_capability_overrides.json next to this
  file, or an explicit --overrides PATH) for a capability this inventory
  cannot derive from artifacts on its own, such as an external CLI. A
  hand-asserted record carries `hand_asserted: true`, an empty
  `source_files` (nothing was read to build it), and is rendered under its
  own visibly separate heading with a [HAND-ASSERTED] marker on every line,
  in `json` output and in the human-readable `capabilities` report alike,
  so it can never be mistaken for something the inventory derived. The
  override file is optional the same way the conflict classes override is:
  absent is silence, not an error; present and malformed is refused BY
  NAME (path and reason printed) and the run falls back to zero overrides,
  never classless-versus-crash, matching decision 34's shape for conflict
  classes.

  No persistence: a capability record is built fresh from the inventory at
  read time, on every run, and is never written to the store. The plan's
  F3 done-check ("a record is DERIVED from artifacts; a hand-asserted
  record is visibly marked") holds without a schema change, because the
  inventory this file already reads IS the artifact evidence; storing a
  second copy would just be a cache with its own staleness to manage.

CONFLICT CLASSES (F2)
  Ten classes, defined once in DEFAULT_CONFLICT_CLASSES below (decision 34:
  the shipped defaults live IN this file as a module constant, so a
  packaged install is never classless). tools/toolkit_conflict_classes.json
  next to this file is an OPTIONAL override: present and valid, it replaces
  the defaults entirely; present and malformed, it is refused BY NAME (the
  path and the reason are printed) and the defaults are used instead;
  absent, that is not an error, only silence, same as every other optional
  surface in this file.

  Each class carries a `detect` description and a `threshold`. A class this
  module knows how to check mechanically against the inventory fires when
  its measured count reaches `threshold`, at the severity the class (or its
  override) declares: info, warn, or fail, and nothing else. A class this
  module has no mechanical detector for reports NO-DATA, named, rather than
  going silent: silence would read as "checked, found nothing," which is
  not true of a surface this file never looked at.

  Every surface that cannot be read (permission error, not-a-directory,
  invalid JSON) is appended to `unreadable` with its path and reason; it
  never crashes the run and never silently vanishes. Absence is NOT
  unreadable: a marketplaces cache directory, a skills directory, or an
  enabledPlugins/mcpServers key that simply does not exist reports zero
  items, not an error, because "nothing here" is a real, readable answer.

  If EVERY one of the four core surfaces (marketplaces cache, user
  settings.json, skills directory, .claude.json) could not be read, the
  tool prints a line starting with the literal "NO-DATA:" and exits 2.
  Otherwise: 0 read something, 2 could not tell at all. There is no exit 1
  in this verb; nothing here is a failure verdict, only an inventory.

EFFECT CLASS: pure_read
  This tool writes NOT ONE BYTE anywhere, ever: no file writes, no
  directories created, no store touched. It never constructs a writable
  bm_store.Store (doing so is itself a write). bm_store is loaded only to
  borrow its resolve_root() for best-effort --root resolution, and that
  call is wrapped so a failure there degrades to os.getcwd(), never a
  crash and never a write.

BE SILENT-SAFE
  Any unexpected exception anywhere in this module is caught by `main` and
  reported as NO-DATA at exit 2, carrying the exception's type and
  message, rather than raising.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. No subprocess.
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.

Usage:
  python3 tools/bm_toolkit.py inventory    [--home PATH] [--root PATH]
  python3 tools/bm_toolkit.py json         [--home PATH] [--root PATH]
  python3 tools/bm_toolkit.py conflicts    [--home PATH] [--root PATH] [--classes PATH]
  python3 tools/bm_toolkit.py capabilities [--home PATH] [--root PATH] [--overrides PATH]
  python3 tools/bm_toolkit.py route TASK-CLASS [--home PATH] [--root PATH] [--routes PATH]

`inventory` is also the default when no verb is given. `--classes` overrides
the conflict class table for `conflicts` only; `--overrides` names the
hand-asserted capability record file for `capabilities` only; `--routes`
overrides the routing table for `route` only; every other verb ignores
whichever of the three it is not given. `route` requires exactly one
positional argument, the task class, given before any flags.
