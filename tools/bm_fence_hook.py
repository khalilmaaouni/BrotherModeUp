"""BrotherMode PreToolUse fence hook: the point where "one writer per file"
stops being a ledger entry and becomes an enforcement boundary.

WHY THIS EXISTS (audit finding 8, confirmed by execution)
  BrotherMode's headline promise is that one record owns a set of paths and
  nobody else writes them. Until this file, that promise was recorded and
  never checked: bm_store.py refuses a second CLAIM that overlaps an active
  fence, but nothing sat between an agent and an actual file write. So an
  agent could edit before claiming, claim an incomplete path set and edit
  the rest, edit a path another record owned, or skip BrotherMode entirely.
  The installed hooks were SessionStart, SessionEnd, Stop and PreCompact:
  none of them can refuse anything, because all of them run after or beside
  the write, never in front of it.

  Claude Code's PreToolUse hook is the mechanism that closes this. It
  receives the tool name and its input as JSON on stdin and may return a
  deny decision that stops the call before the tool runs. Contract read from
  https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks on 2026-07-27; the exact stdin
  fields and the exact deny shape this file emits are quoted in
  docs/HOOKS.md, which is the document to update if that contract moves.

THE THREE RULES THIS FILE OBEYS
  1. FAIL OPEN, LOUDLY. This hook sits in front of every edit the founder
     makes. A hook that failed closed on its own bug would brick editing
     entirely, so every failure path here (no root, no store, unreadable
     store, corrupt store, unparseable payload, zero claims, any unexpected
     exception) allows the write and prints the reason to stderr. A refusal
     must always come from a real ownership conflict, never from this file
     being broken.
  2. STDOUT IS THE DECISION CHANNEL AND NOTHING ELSE. Claude Code parses
     stdout as JSON. Every diagnostic goes to stderr. That is why this file
     has exactly two output funnels (_out, _warn) and no bare print.
  3. CANONICAL PATHS ONLY. A comparison between unresolved path strings is
     bypassed by '..', by a symlink, by a relative path typed from a
     subdirectory, or by case on a case-insensitive filesystem. Every target
     path is realpath'd and expressed root-relative before it is compared,
     and the comparison itself is bm_store.paths_overlap, the same function
     the store uses to admit a claim, so the fence the hook enforces and the
     fence the store granted can never drift apart.

IDENTITY (audit finding 8B)
  See docs/HOOKS.md for the full statement including the residual limit. In
  short: a session's secret token lives in an owner-only file inside
  .brothermode and is never printed anywhere; the PUBLIC session label that
  STATE.md shows is a one-way hash of that token. Ownership is
  record.session_id == hash(my token). Reading the public label out of
  STATE.md and passing it as your own session therefore buys nothing: the
  hook derives your label from the token you can actually open, not from the
  string you claim to be.

Python 3.9, standard library only, cross-platform. No em or en dashes
anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.

# The tool surface this hook governs.

#: Tools that write a file through a structured, parseable path argument.
#: Bash is DELIBERATELY ABSENT from this set: a shell command can write any
#: file, and no reliable parse of arbitrary shell exists, so pretending to
#: gate it would be a guarantee this file cannot keep (stated as a known gap
#: in docs/HOOKS.md rather than papered over here). ONE Bash shape is gated
#: anyway, in decide() rather than here: the apply_patch envelope, a
#: structured write wearing a Bash costume, which is how EVERY file write
#: arrives under the OpenAI Codex CLI (measured 2026-08-05 on codex-cli
#: 0.146.0, recorded in docs/RUNTIMES.md). Arbitrary shell that writes files
#: any other way remains the stated gap.
WRITE_TOOLS = frozenset((
    "Edit",
    "Write",
    "MultiEdit",
    "NotebookEdit",
    "CreateDirectory",
    "Delete",
))

#: The apply_patch envelope grammar this hook reads, and all of it. Between
#: "*** Begin Patch" and "*** End Patch", file directives are lines
#: "*** Add File: <path>", "*** Update File: <path>", "*** Delete File:
#: <path>", and a rename's "*** Move to: <path>", whose TARGET is also a
#: written path. Grammar taken from the payload captured off a real Codex
#: 0.146 session on 2026-08-05, not from memory. Codex fires PreToolUse and
#: never PostToolUse for apply_patch (measured twice), so the decision made
#: here is the WHOLE decision: there is no second look after the write.
#:
#: TWO STRUCTURAL FACTS the parser must respect, both found by an adversarial
#: refuter on 2026-08-06 (docs/program/absolute-lead/evidence/L06):
#:   1. A real directive sits at COLUMN 0. A line that begins with a space,
#:      "+" or "-" is hunk body (context, added, removed), i.e. CONTENT of
#:      the file being written, NEVER a directive. Stripping leading
#:      whitespace before matching turned a context line that quotes the
#:      grammar into a phantom directive and fenced a file the patch never
#:      touched. So directives are matched at column 0 only.
#:   2. The envelope is a WRITE only when apply_patch is the program that
#:      actually receives it. The marker text appears at the start of lines
#:      inside "cat > doc <<EOF ...", inside a "git commit" message, inside
#:      this very file: none of those invoke apply_patch. So the parser reads
#:      the heredoc that carries the envelope and only treats it as a write
#:      when the command owning that heredoc is apply_patch.

#: The one token that has to be present for any of the heredoc work to run.

#: path out taken before any parsing, on EVERY Bash call under Claude Code
#: once the matcher widens.
