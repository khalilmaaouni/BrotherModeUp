description: Recommend the single best next step for the project
---

Outcome to produce: one recommended next action, stated first, with a short reason and a realistic time range. Alternatives only when they are materially useful.

Enter the next-step flow of the brotherme skill. Run the mechanical command `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/bm_lead.py" status --project-id <id>` (the packaged console script is `bm-lead status`) and take the recommendation from its Next step field, which is computed from that project's own records and is always exactly one action with the reason it was chosen. Never answer from memory of this conversation, and never read CANVAS.md by hand, since CANVAS.md is a generated view, not the source of truth. A plugin install exports `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for skill and command content, so that path resolves on its own; on a clone install, where the variable is unset, run `python3 tools/bm_lead.py status --project-id <id>` instead, from the BrotherMode root (`~/.claude/skills/brothermode`). Either way, run it from the user's project folder so it reads that project's own records.

Present that recommendation as exactly one next step, with its reason. Estimates follow the rules in references/forecasting.md: always ranges with a confidence level, never single numbers.

When a decision from the user is what blocks progress, the Next step field says so, and that decision comes first, as a decision card in the shape of references/kickoff.md, recommended option first with its Why. The last option on that card is always the user's own: they can take the decision and the work under it back, and the project records where the work stopped and what would have been chosen. Never drop that option to shorten the card.

To see the ranked task list behind the recommendation rather than the single recommended action, run `python3 tools/bm_project.py next` and read its output. That is the machinery view of the same question, shown only when the user asks for it.
