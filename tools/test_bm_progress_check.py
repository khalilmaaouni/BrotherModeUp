"""Regression tests for tools/bm_progress_check.py, the mechanical check for
the founder's progress-page rule ("every project shows a Gantt-style page,
and a session never has to be asked for it").

WHAT THIS SUITE IS ACTUALLY DEFENDING
  The rule that a project must SHOW its progress page, not just build it, is
  written down in prose in more than one place already, and prose has never
  once stopped a session from skipping the step. This tool is the mechanical
  half: a plan exists, a page exists, the page is newer than the plan. This
  suite proves each of the four real verdicts (NO-PLAN, OWED-MISSING,
  OWED-STALE, CURRENT) plus the NO-DATA failure mode, proves every glob
  pattern the contract names is actually recognised, and above all proves
  the tool is READ-ONLY: it runs at every session start, so a crash or a
  stray write here would break every session on the machine, not just this
  one check.

Every fixture is a tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(), never the real repository.
mtimes are set explicitly with os.utime so ordering is deterministic and
does not depend on how fast the machine runs the test.

Standard library only. Run: python3 tools/test_bm_progress_check.py
