"""bm_view.py: the live project view and its CLI (loop L05,
docs/program/absolute-lead/DESIGN-visual-surface.md sections 3, 4, 8, 9.3,
11.4 and 12.2).

WHAT THIS IS
  The THIRD renderer over L04's one collector, and the page it writes:
  PROJECT-VIEW.html, one self contained file at the project root, written
  through bs.write_generated_document, generated from store rows and never
  hand maintained. It issues no SQL of its own, defines no collector of
  its own (an ast guard in tools/test_bm_view.py fails the build on
  either), and draws nothing itself: every picture comes from
  tools/bm_visual.py, every one of the eight status fields comes from
  tools/bm_lead.py's collect_status, and every duration comes from
  bl.render_forecast_lines. The moment this file needs a query the store
  does not already offer, it has become a second writer and the query
  belongs in bm_store.py.

THE ONE DOOR, AND WHY IT IS THE FIRST THING IN THIS FILE
  Founder decision, 2026-08-05, unchanged from L04: NOTHING renders or
  writes before setup consent. _store_or_refuse is the ONLY function in
  this file that constructs a store, and it refuses without consent.
  main() computes the consent state ONCE, before the COMMANDS lookup, and
  refuses the whole dispatch when it is false: a human-invoked command
  prints the setup sentence, the two hook-wired invocations (render
  --if-stale and alert --tick) print nothing at all, and doorway is the
  ONE subcommand exempt from the gate, because it writes nothing, opens
  no store, and exists precisely so minute zero has an answer.

SUBCOMMANDS
  render      writes PROJECT-VIEW.html from rows; --if-stale rewrites it
              only when the fingerprint moved, silently, for the hook
  url         reads or records the published page address for a view
  doorway     the minute zero block: no store, no consent, no writes
  explain     one refusal reason code, rewritten as the five part block
  brief-page  the developer brief as one HTML page beside its markdown
  alert       --tick, the hook entry point: one JSON object when a
              NEEDS YOU stands, nothing otherwise

WHAT THIS IS NOT
  Not a server and not a daemon: the page changes only when this command
  runs again. Not a publisher: the stored URL is written back by whoever
  published, and publishing itself is Claude's act, not this file's. Not
  a second truth: the page states the newest record it was built from and
  a content fingerprint, never its own render clock, so two runs on the
  same rows are byte identical.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network, at render time or ever.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.
