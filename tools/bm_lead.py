"""bm_lead.py: the founder surface, and the engineer's view of the same
records (loop L04, docs/program/absolute-lead/DESIGN-L04.md sections 3, 4,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12).

WHAT THIS IS
  A THIN CLI over tools/bm_store.py's service methods and read accessors,
  in exactly the sense tools/bm_project.py, tools/bm_autonomy.py and
  tools/bm_controller.py already state as house law: it issues no SQL of
  its own, and a structural guard (tools/test_bm_lead.py, TestNoSQLGuard)
  fails the build if a SQL-shaped literal or a sqlite3 import ever appears
  here. The moment this file needs a query the store does not already
  offer, it has become a second writer and must be folded back into
  bm_store.py instead of growing one here.

THE ONE DOOR, AND WHY IT IS THE FIRST THING IN THIS FILE
  Founder decision, 2026-08-05: the half-hour catch-up ships ON BY DEFAULT
  and NOTHING may write before setup consent. This project has broken that
  law twice, and both times an outside reviewer caught it rather than its
  own tests, so absence of a write is not enough here.

  So: _store_or_refuse is the ONLY function in this file that constructs a
  store, and it refuses without consent. A writer who forgets the check
  cannot obtain a handle at all. main() computes the consent state ONCE,
  before the COMMANDS lookup, and refuses the whole dispatch when it is
  false: a human-invoked command prints the setup sentence, and the
  watchdog prints nothing at all, because a hook is never a place to ask a
  question. Consent itself is not defined here: scripts/setup.py is loaded
  BY PATH and its own read_config and is_consented are called, so there is
  no second definition of what consent means. tools/test_bm_lead.py parses
  this file with ast and fails if a second store constructor is ever
  added.

SUBCOMMANDS
  outcome        where the work stands, and the one recommended next
                  action; with --set, records the outcome the founder
                  states
  status         the eight fields of references/status-view.md, computed
                  from records rather than narrated
  decisions      the open key decisions, highest stakes first, each as a
                  card whose last option is always the handback
  brief          the short catch-up; when nothing has happened it names
                  the one that still stands and writes nothing
  insight        appends one row to the record of what was decided and why
  handback       hands one decision and the work under it back to the
                  founder, in five acts in one fixed order
  handover-pack  the seven handover pages an analyst can take over from
  watchdog       --tick, the hook entry point: a due-check, never a
                  background process

WHAT THIS IS NOT
  Not a second controller driver: nothing here moves a controller run
  state, and no CONTROLLER_STATE_TRANSITIONS entry is used. Not a second
  writer of a project row: the outcome goes through Store.upsert_project,
  the same method tools/bm_project.py's start uses. Not a background
  process: it imports no subprocess, no asyncio, no urllib and no socket,
  and the watchdog is a due-check on a tick the product already has.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.
