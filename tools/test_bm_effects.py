"""Tests for tools/bm_effects.py, the effect-class registry.

WHAT THIS SUITE PROVES
  1. Every REGISTRY value is one of the five declared classes (a typo in
     a class string fails loudly, not silently).
  2. declared() raises on an undeclared (module, command) pair rather
     than defaulting to anything.
  3. COMPLETENESS: every `def cmd_<name>` this suite can mechanically
     discover across every tools/bm_*.py and tools/brothermode_cli.py is
     declared in REGISTRY. A module whose dispatch is a plain if/elif
     chain rather than a lookup dict (tools/bm_ledger.py,
     tools/bm_telemetry.py, tools/bm_autosave.py) cannot be resolved to a
     verb by this mechanical scan; those commands are named as NO-DATA
     rather than silently passed over, and are not required to appear in
     REGISTRY, because inventing a verb mapping this suite cannot verify
     is exactly the kind of guess REGISTRY exists to refuse.
  4. PURITY: every command declared pure_read is run as a real
     subprocess against a real, freshly initialized throwaway project,
     and the project directory (store file, WAL/SHM sidecars, every
     generated file) must come out byte-identical. A command documented
     as read-only that actually writes fails HERE, which is the point:
     this suite exists to catch the eighth instance of that bug before
     it merges.
  5. --HELP PURITY: `<module> --help` (the bare form) for every module in
     REGISTRY, and `<module> <verb> --help` for every pure_read command
     (see TestHelpPurity's own docstring for why the verb-level form is
     also necessary to catch tools/bm_threads.py's documented "ignores
     --help entirely" defect), must both write nothing.

ISOLATION (load-bearing, read before touching this file)
  BROTHERMODE_VAULT is exported ambient on the machine this project
  usually runs on, and it WINS over HOME in every module that resolves a
  vault path. A HOME-only override does NOT isolate a subprocess from a
  real founder vault; this is the exact incident
  tools/test_bm_packaging_install.py's setUpClass documents and guards
  against, and this suite copies that pattern rather than re-deriving it:
  every subprocess here runs with a from-scratch environment that pins
  HOME, BROTHERMODE_VAULT, BROTHERSBE_VAULT and BROTHERMODE_ROOT inside
  one throwaway tempfile tree, never inheriting the invoking shell's
  environment.

No wall-clock timing assertions anywhere in this file (see
tools/bm_lint_walltime.py, which this file itself must pass clean).

# Mechanical discovery: every `def cmd_<name>` in a module, mapped to the

# nested routing (tools/bm_project.py's `task`/`forecast`/`alert` ->
# TASK_COMMANDS/FORECAST_COMMANDS/ALERT_COMMANDS), which is the only
# nested shape this codebase actually uses. A module with no such dict at
# all (an if/elif chain on sys.argv) yields nothing discoverable; every

    """The condition under which the defect is actually REACHABLE, added
    2026-08-10 after the first purity design could not see it.

    WHY THIS CLASS EXISTS, and it is the more useful half of this file.
    The purity test above snapshots a throwaway tree before and after a
    command and asserts byte equality. Against a HEALTHY store that test
    passes for every command, including the ones documented as read-only
    that open a WRITABLE Store. Measured, not assumed: sqlite auto
    checkpoints and removes the -wal and -shm files when the last
    connection closes cleanly, _ensure_git_excludes is idempotent and
    already satisfied, and a pure SELECT leaves the main database file
    byte identical. So the whole-process snapshot observes nothing.

    That is a probe that cannot reach the defect, which is a failure class
    this repository has recorded twice before, and it nearly went down as
    evidence that the commands were clean.

    The reachable condition is a store that is BEHIND. Store.__init__
    calls _verify_schema_or_raise(migrate=True), so any command that
    constructs a writable Store against an out of date database MIGRATES
    IT. Demonstrated by hand on 2026-08-10 before this test was written:
    a store forced to schema_version 17 was handed to
    `bm_project.py status --project-id nosuch`, a command documented as a
    read accessor, which exited 1 having found no such project, and the
    database came back at schema_version 18 with a different md5. A read
    only command migrated a database while failing.

    So this class is the one that gives the pure_read declaration meaning.
    It is EXPECTED TO FAIL for every command still opening a writable
    Store, and each failure names a real defect rather than a test
    artefact."""
