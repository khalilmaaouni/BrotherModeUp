"""Packaging install suite: C-06. Every console script pyproject.toml
declares must reach an installed user's PATH and actually run, not merely
appear to build. Builds a real venv, installs the real package into it with
pip (never a git checkout added to sys.path), and drives the installed
commands as subprocesses exactly the way a stranger who ran
`pip install brothermode` would.

Deliberately separate from tools/test_bm.py's
TestP17PackagingManifestMatchesTheRepository: that suite is a fast, offline,
text-only read of pyproject.toml (its own docstring says so) and can never
catch a module that is declared but unreachable at runtime, which is
exactly how this item was opened (brotherme/core/schema.py shipped absent,
then shipped but unreachable, from a flat install). This suite is the
register's own adversarial test: "install into a fresh virtualenv and
invoke each documented command."

Needs network egress once, to upgrade pip/setuptools/wheel inside its own
throwaway venv: this machine's system pip (21.2.4) silently mis-builds and
says nothing (docs/PACKAGING.md, "One build command on this machine is
broken, and it fails quietly"). Skips rather than fails if that upgrade
cannot reach PyPI, because a missing network is an environment fact, not a
packaging regression.

Slow (builds and installs a real package, tens of seconds) and therefore
not part of the always-run fast gate by default; run directly:
