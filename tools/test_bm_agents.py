"""Native agent definition contract tests. Run: python3 tools/test_bm_agents.py

WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
  The plan's Agent 6 section (Native Agent Definition Engineer) requires the
  five existing BrotherMode worker profiles (references/profiles.md,
  references/delegation.md) to also exist as Claude Code plugin-native agent
  definitions in agents/, each pinned to the exact model, effort, isolation,
  and read-only shape the plan states: fast-worker (haiku, medium, worktree),
  builder (sonnet, high, worktree), researcher (sonnet, high, read-only),
  navigator (opus, xhigh, read-only), reviewer (opus, xhigh, read-only). This
  suite reads the files and pins that shape mechanically, so a frontmatter
  typo, a dropped file, or a quietly added capability is caught here instead
  of trusting a brief's description of them.

  Field names and their support for plugin-shipped agents are read from the
  official Claude Code docs (Plugins reference, "Agents" section, and
  Subagents, "Supported frontmatter fields"), fetched 2026-08-08, not from
  memory: hooks, mcpServers, and permissionMode are named there as
  unsupported for plugin agents, and "worktree" is named as the only valid
  isolation value.

Standard library only. Python 3.9. Reads files, writes none.
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.
