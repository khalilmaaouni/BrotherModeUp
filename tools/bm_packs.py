"""BrotherMode gate deep-dive packs: one document an engineer can review.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
  A founder gate asks a human to approve a decision. Today that human sees a
  sentence. This writes the rest: what the decision is, what happens if it is
  wrong, what the options were, the CODE that would change quoted live from
  disk, everyone who depends on those lines, the blast radius and the rollback
  command, what the store already recorded about this area, a diagram of the
  affected path, and the slots where a named engineer records a verdict.

  Phase A of docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-documentation-and-gate-packs
  -design.md, section 4. Nothing is generated until asked: `stakes` prints the
  one line a question window carries, `pack` writes the document.

THE THREE RULES THIS FILE LIVES BY
  I11, A CITED EXCERPT MUST RESOLVE. Every excerpt is re-read from disk at
  generation time and checked against the anchor text and content hash recorded
  the last time the pack was written. A citation that no longer resolves is a
  LOUD failure with a stated remedy (--recite), never a quietly stale quote. A
  pack whose code section is fiction is worse than no pack: it is a review of
  something that is not there.

  I10, GENERATED OUTPUT NEVER DESTROYS HUMAN TEXT. Anything a human wrote
  between the human markers is carried through regeneration byte for byte.

  DISCOVERED, NOT ASSERTED. The dependency map comes from searching the tree
  for callers, tests and documents. Nothing in it is remembered or guessed, and
  the search that found each hit is printed with it.

WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DO
  It never writes the database directly: every store mutation goes through
  bm_store.py, which stays the single writer, and the pack file itself is
  written through bm_store.write_generated_document, the one funnel that
  redacts before anything reaches disk. No network, no subprocess.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
  It does not write prose about the decision that the store did not record. The
  paragraphs are assembled from recorded fields; where a field is empty the pack
  says the field is empty and names the command that would fill it. A generator
  that invents a rationale is a generator that puts words in the founder's
  mouth.

  It does not render a candidate's raw captured text. That is the most sensitive
  column in the store, withheld here exactly as `show-candidate` withholds it.

Python 3.9, standard library only.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.
