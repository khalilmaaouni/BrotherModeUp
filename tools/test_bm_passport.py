"""Regression tests for tools/bm_passport.py, the change passport's producer
half (docs/specs/2026-08-15-change-passport-seam.md in the BrotherSBE
repository is the contract this tool fills a hole in).

WHAT THIS SUITE IS ACTUALLY DEFENDING
  Three rules from the contract, each load bearing and each proven by a test
  whose guard was removed by hand to watch it go red:

  1. A hollow value is never written. An empty string, an empty list, or a
     null reads as absence on the consuming side, so a field this tool
     cannot establish honestly must be OMITTED, never padded to look
     filled.
  2. Direction of travel: this tool writes the deposit and reads NOTHING
     under .sbe/. A poisoned tasks.json sitting next to a healthy store
     must change nothing about what this tool produces.
  3. Absent, corrupt, and healthy stores are three DIFFERENT reported
     states, and none of the three ever crashes the tool.

Every fixture is a tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(), never the real project
store. The CLI is invoked as a real subprocess so its argument parsing,
exit codes, and stdout are exercised exactly as a caller would see them.

ADDED: the `generate` verb (schema/change-passport.v1.json), a second,
additive CLI shape on the same tool that writes the full five field
passport rather than the three field deposit above. Its own section below
covers: a round trip from a fixture store built through the Store write
API (never a hand written store file), determinism across two generate
calls sharing one --now, the standalone validator (tools/
bm_passport_validator.py) against the canonical fixture and the three
fixtures that each break exactly one rule, and a read only proof that
BrotherSBE's own consumer (tools/sbe_passport.py in that sibling
repository) reports fields 2 and 5 as CARRIED from a deposited canonical
passport. That last test is guarded: it skips, by name, when the sibling
repository is not present on the machine running this suite.
