"""BrotherMode Bash-write DETECTION hook (Loop 6 design D-1): the honest
answer to the one gap docs/HOOKS.md has stated for months and never closed.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  tools/bm_fence_hook.py enforces one writer per file for Edit, Write,
  MultiEdit and NotebookEdit, and it says so itself: Bash is deliberately
  absent from WRITE_TOOLS, because no reliable parse of arbitrary shell
  exists and pretending to gate it would be a guarantee that file cannot
  keep. A shell redirect, `sed -i`, `tee`, or a script invoked through Bash
  can still cross a fence, invisibly, and until this file nothing noticed.

  Gating Bash is not on the table (it would need a PreToolUse payload that
  names the files a command will touch, which the harness does not provide,
  or an OS-level write mediator, which is outside "Python 3.9, standard
  library only"). What IS achievable without either of those: notice AFTER
  the fact. This file is a PreToolUse/PostToolUse PAIR, both wired to the
  same `Bash` matcher, that snapshots every fenced file before a Bash call
  and re-hashes it after. When a fenced file changed and the session that
  ran the Bash call is not that fence's owner, it raises a real alert row
  through the service layer and prints one plain sentence to stderr. That
  is detection, not prevention: the write already happened. Docs/HOOKS.md
  and docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md say so in as many words, because a reader who
  believes this closes the Bash gap has been misled.

THE RULES THIS FILE OBEYS (same three bm_fence_hook.py states, plus one)
  1. FAIL OPEN, LOUDLY, IN THE DEFAULT MODE. Both entrypoints always return
     0, whatever went wrong, and by default nothing here ever blocks a Bash
     call. A hook that failed closed on its own bug would brick every shell
     command the founder runs. Every failure path prints its reason to
     stderr, same policy as bm_fence_hook.py's own stated one.
     ONE EXCEPTION, added for C-02 (2026-08-03) and opt-in only: when
     BM_FENCE_MODE=enforced AND the Bash call's cwd resolves to a
     BrotherMode project, the pre phase REFUSES a Bash command that matches
     an obvious destructive form aimed at BrotherMode's own enforcement
     state (the store file, the fence token directory). Outside a
     BrotherMode project this hook is installed at user-global scope, so
     that project check is load-bearing, not decoration: without it,
     enforced mode would refuse commands anywhere on the machine. See
     refusal_for() for exactly what that can and cannot catch, in its own
     words. The default mode is byte-for-byte unchanged.
  2. STDOUT IS THE DECISION CHANNEL AND NOTHING ELSE. A PreToolUse hook's
     stdout is the permission decision channel. This hook writes to it in
     exactly one situation, the enforced-mode refusal in rule 1, and it
     writes the deny object and nothing else; the post phase never writes to
     stdout at all. Every diagnostic, including the sentences naming a
     breach or a lost store, goes to stderr.
  3. CANONICAL PATHS AND IDENTITY, SHARED WITH THE FENCE HOOK, NOT
     REIMPLEMENTED. This file loads tools/bm_fence_hook.py by path (the same
     importlib-by-path technique bm_fence_hook.py itself uses for
     tools/bm_store.py) and calls its own `active_claims` and
     `session_label`, so "which paths are fenced" and "does this session own
     that fence" can never drift from what the PreToolUse fence hook already
     enforces for Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit. The store itself is
     never opened directly by sqlite3 here for the READ half either: it goes
     through tools/bm_store.py exactly the way bm_fence_hook.py resolves it
     (ReadOnlyStore, inside active_claims). Only the WRITE half (raising the
     alert) opens a writable Store, because ReadOnlyStore has no path to
     raise_alert by construction.
  4. CONSENT-GATED, MIRRORING tools/bm_autosave.py. Pre-consent, both
     entrypoints check first, before reading stdin, before touching the
     filesystem, and print one sentence naming `scripts/setup.py`. Nothing
     is written, not a snapshot file, not an alert row.

WHAT THIS ACTUALLY COVERS, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED
  A snapshot only exists for a claim path that is a REAL, EXISTING FILE at
  the moment the Bash call starts (a literal `os.path.isfile` check on the
  claim's stored path, root-relative, joined onto the project root). A
  claim on a directory or a glob-shaped path (bm_store.paths_overlap's `*`,
  `?`, `[` handling) is not expanded into the files it would cover: this
  file does not walk the tree to discover what a glob claim spans, so a new
  file created inside a claimed directory during the Bash call is invisible
  to it. That is a real, stated limitation, not a silent gap: see the "What
  this cannot see" section of docs/HOOKS.md.

Python 3.9, standard library only, cross-platform. No em or en dashes
anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.

    WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT DO, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED. This is not a
    shell parser and cannot become one here, for the reason bm_fence_hook.py
    already gives for leaving Bash out of WRITE_TOOLS. It matches two things
    and only two:

      A. the command TEXT contains one of this project's own state names as
         a literal substring (bm_store.STORE_DIRNAME or STORE_FILENAME) AND
         it matches one of the destructive shell forms above.
      B. the command TEXT matches one of a very small set of forms that
         empty or rewrite the whole working directory without naming
         anything at all.

    It therefore catches every form the C-02 reproduction used (rm,
    redirection, sed -i, tee, an inline python3 -c, git checkout). It MISSES,
    by construction and not by oversight:
      - a name assembled at runtime ('d=.brother; rm -f ${d}mode/...'),
      - a name reached through a variable, an alias, a shell function, or a
        script FILE whose contents this hook never sees,
      - any program that removes the file without the name appearing in the
        command at all (an editor, a runtime reading the path from a config,
        a second process this command merely starts),
      - every destructive form not in the two lists above.
    And it OVER-refuses on purpose: a read-only command that merely mentions
    the directory next to any redirection ('ls .brothermode > /tmp/x') is
    refused too, and so is 'git clean -x' anywhere in the tree. Erring toward
    refusal is the deliberate choice, because the alternative inside a
