"""The canonical project protocol, in code.

SOURCE OF TRUTH: docs/specs/canonical-project-protocol.md. Every field list,
state name, and enumerated value here restates that document, and
tools/test_bm_schema.py parses the document's own YAML blocks and state list
to assert the two cannot drift apart silently. When they disagree, the
document wins and this file is the one that is wrong.

WHAT LIVES HERE
  1. The five canonical object shapes (Project, Forecast, Task,
     AttributionEvent, Alert) with validate(), to_dict() and from_dict().
  2. The ten task lifecycle states, LEGAL_TRANSITIONS, and transition(),
     which refuses an illegal move by naming the from-state, the to-state,
     and the legal moves. `done` is not a state and is refused by name,
     because the document says so in as many words.

Storage lives in the store now, not here: tools/bm_store.py schema 12 holds
the five shapes as tables and calls into this module for validation and
legality before every write. This module used to also own an append-only
JSONL event stream (append_event, read_events); that stream is retired
(Loop 1 delete-list D3, replayed into the store with nothing left to
replay), so this module is shapes and legality only.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. No subprocess. No files.

No em or en dashes anywhere in this file, its comments, or its output.
