"""bm_escalate.py: the attempt ledger, and the rule that says stop and ask.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  Founder ask, 2026-08-15: "the system should also be able to recognise when
  it is stuck and has tried every method possible and ask for help, guidance,
  give recommendation or handover to a human as needed when needed."

  Three partial answers already existed and none of them covered an ordinary
  session:
    - tools/bm_controller.py escalates a unit that failed twice, and only
      inside a running Full-Auto controller.
    - BrotherSBE's worker brief carries maxAttemptsPerApproach: 2 as a
      SENTENCE in a brief, which this product's own first law says is not a
      control.
    - tools/bm_stall.py and BrotherSBE's stall detector watch dead workers,
      stale fences, disk floor and owed handovers. They detect a stuck
      MACHINE. Nothing detected a stuck LINE OF REASONING.

  So no counter anywhere recorded that the same objective had defeated three
  different approaches, and no rule turned that count into a decision. This
  file is that counter and that rule.

WHAT IT DOES
  attempt   record one attempt against an objective (approach, observed root
            cause, verdict, evidence).
  check     answer one question about an objective: CONTINUE or ESCALATE,
            with the trigger named. Pure read.
  packet    print the escalation packet in the checkpoint shape both products
            already define. REFUSES to print one without a recommendation and
            a default action.
  resolve   close an open escalation with what the human decided.
  open      list every open escalation in this project, for a session-close
            check. Pure read.

THE FOUR TRIGGERS, any one is enough (decide_verdict, one pure function)
  forcing_condition      a named condition where guessing is the danger, so
                         the count never applies: an irreversible action with
                         ambiguous intent, a missing owner, unavailable
                         credentials, authoritative sources that conflict, or
                         the tool being asked to approve its own exception.
                         Escalates at zero attempts, deliberately.
  approaches_exhausted   3 or more DISTINCT approaches have failed.
  no_new_information     2 attempts failed with the same observed root cause.
                         A repeat buys nothing, which is the real signal;
                         this is BrotherSBE's prose rule promoted to a count.
  budget_spent           a budget was declared for the objective, the attempts
                         are spent, and no attempt has passed since it opened.

  Never on a single failure, with ONE exception, taken from the architecture
  review of 2026-08-15: an attempt marked --truth-affecting escalates on the
  first failure. A wrong status, or a PASS with a known counterexample, is a
  defect in what this product sells, and burning a second attempt on it just
  means the wrong answer stands longer. Everywhere else the floor holds,
  because a system that asks for help too early is as useless as one that
  never asks.

WHAT THIS FILE NEVER DOES
  It never answers the question, never retries anything, and never decides on
  behalf of the human. Like the stall sweep next to it, it reports and the
  session or the person acts. A monitor wired to a control is a control
  defect, not a feature.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT ENFORCED, stated plainly because W5 of the review this
came from requires it
  ENFORCED: the verdict itself, and the packet's refusal to be printed
  hollow. Both are this file, both are covered by tools/test_bm_escalate.py.
  NOT ENFORCED: that a session records its attempts at all, and that a
  session with an open escalation does not simply stop. The second one is
  closable by a Stop hook (docs/ESCALATION.md carries the snippet); until
  that hook is wired into hooks/hooks.json, which is another lane's file,
  this paragraph is the discipline and the tool is only its instrument.

Python 3.9 floor, standard library only, like every other tool here.
