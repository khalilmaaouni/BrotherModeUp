"""rehearse_fresh_install.py: the fresh-HOME install rehearsal, run for real.

WHY THIS EXISTS (Loop 3 design D-6, docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-
loop3-consent-install-design.md, work package WP-F)
  The program gate is "fresh-machine install without developer help". This
  file is the one scripted rehearsal of that gate on this machine: it drives
  the CLONE-path story end to end, exactly as docs/QUICKSTART.md and
  docs/SETUP.md tell a stranger to do it, inside temporary directories with
  HOME and BROTHERME_CONFIG overridden so the real HOME and the real
  ~/.claude are never touched.

WHAT "CLONE" MEANS HERE, DISCLOSED
  Step 1 copies this repository's working tree into a fake
  ~/.claude/skills/brothermode instead of running `git clone`. That is a
  disclosed stand-in, not the real command: the docs' own clone step pulls a
  tagged release over the network from GitHub, and running that here would
  test GitHub and the network, not this machine's install code. The copy
  excludes .git, .brothermode, and node_modules, the same exclusion list
  scripts/checksums.sh and scripts/verify-install.sh already use for the same
  reason. Every other step below runs the actual project scripts against the
  fake HOME: scripts/install.py, scripts/setup.py, scripts/doctor.py,
  tools/bm_project.py, and scripts/uninstall.py, none of them simulated.

THE SEVEN STEPS
  1. copy (stands in for git clone) into fakehome/.claude/skills/brothermode
  2. python3 tools/test_all.py from the copy (skippable with --skip-gate for
     time; the default runs it)
  3. scripts/install.py, dry-run then real, against a fake settings.json
  4. scripts/setup.py flag mode consent, plus the vault-template copy
     docs/SETUP.md Step 3 documents (needed for doctor's vault check to have
     a real directory to check)
  5. scripts/doctor.py --json: fence, consent, vault, duplicate_install and
     settings_json checks are asserted; checksums is recorded as-is, not
     asserted, because this is a live development tree and CHECKSUMS.sha256
     was cut against a clean release commit, not this moment's working copy
  6. one project through tools/bm_project.py in a fresh project directory
     under the fake HOME: start, task add, several task state moves, a
     review call, status, next, deliver --partial
  7. scripts/uninstall.py --remove-consent, then three assertions: the hook
     entries are gone from settings.json, the consent config file is gone,
     and a byte-for-byte vault file manifest (taken right after the vault is
     created in step 4) is unchanged

WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE (named here, restated in the evidence file)
  One physical machine, the author's own environment, no second machine, no
  naive user (that is Loop 8's outside-install list), and the plugin path is
  not exercised at all here (this rehearsal is the clone path only).

Python 3.9, standard library only. No em or en dashes anywhere in this file,
its comments, or its output.

# step 0: the I1/I2 pre-consent no-write probe (external review, Loop 3/5,
# extended 2026-08-02 after Loop 9 Criticals 1 and 2)
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   I1 (the most serious finding of that review) reproduced tools/
#   bm_autosave.py's cmd_precompact writing a namespaced git ref, a
#   snapshot commit, and a JSON event file with NO ~/.brotherme/config.json
#   present at all. tools/test_bm_autosave.py now carries the unit-level
#   proof of the fix; this step is the PERMANENT, EXECUTED demonstration of
#   the same fact against the real binaries, in the exact fresh-machine
#   shape this whole rehearsal exists to reproduce: a throwaway git repo,
#   no consent config anywhere BROTHERME_CONFIG could resolve to (this step
#   runs right after the clone, step 1, and strictly before step 4, the
#   only step that ever creates one).
#
#   THIS STEP USED TO HARDCODE A LIST OF "the three real write-capable
#   entry points" and drive one program per hook EVENT. That list itself
#   was the bug: hooks/hooks.json's PreCompact line runs TWO programs off
#   one stdin payload (tools/bm_autosave.py precompact and tools/
#   bm_telemetry.py precompact-brief), and the Stop hook (tools/
#   bm_telemetry.py stop-warn) was not driven at all. Both wrote the
#   founder's own words into a fresh ~/BrotherModeVault before consent
#   existed (Loop 9 Criticals 1 and 2), and this probe's own hand-
#   maintained list never noticed, because a list beside hooks.json can
#   drift from hooks.json silently while a probe that reads hooks.json
#   cannot. See the 2026-08-02 addendum in
#   docs/evidence/2026-08-01-fresh-home-rehearsal.md for the full account.
#
#   This step now PARSES hooks/hooks.json (parse_hook_programs) and drives
#   EVERY program named on EVERY hook line, however many programs one line
#   runs, with a payload shaped for that program's own hook contract
#   (_payload_for_invocation). An invocation this file has no payload for
#   is a hard FAIL, not a silent skip, because silently skipping an
#   unrecognized program is exactly how the old list went stale. The
#   assertion is no longer "the three programs I already knew about wrote
#   nothing": it is that the fresh HOME holds ZERO files BrotherMode wrote,
#   full stop (Python's own bytecode cache under Library/Caches excepted;
#   see IGNORED_HOME_PREFIXES).
#
#   Numbered "step 0", not inserted into the seven-step STEP_TITLES
#   tuple: it predates step 2 (the test-suite gate) and every step after
#   it, chronologically, and giving it its own number keeps every
#   existing step's number exactly what evidence readers already know it
#   to be, rather than renumbering seven historically-referenced steps for
#   one addition.
