"""Suite for tools/bm_runtimes.py, the cross runtime adapter generator.

WHAT THIS SUITE IS ACTUALLY DEFENDING
  The generator's output is documentation that other people will act on. The
  failure mode is not a crash: it is a confident sentence that is false. Three
  shapes of false sentence are worth gating, and each has a test below that has
  been shown capable of failing:

    1. An INVENTED COMMAND. The adapter files tell five runtimes which
       BrotherMode commands to run. If one of those names drifts, every adapter
       teaches a command that does not exist, and the agent reading it reports
       a broken install rather than a renamed subcommand.

    2. DRIFT between the registry, the committed adapter files, and the
       capability table in docs/RUNTIMES.md. All three are generated from one
       registry precisely so they cannot disagree, which is only true while
       something checks.

    3. A CONFLATED CAPABILITY CLAIM. "This runtime has PreToolUse" and
       "BrotherMode's fence hook runs in this runtime" are different claims and
       only the first is verified anywhere but Claude Code. An adapter file that
       lost the second half of that sentence would talk a founder into wiring a
       gate that fails open while looking installed.

Python 3.9, standard library only. subprocess is used to drive the real CLI,
which is local execution, not a network call.

    The first run block was written to fix instructions that could not run. Its

    and exits 2 without them:

        usage: start --project-id ID --name NAME ... --actor-name NAME ...
        bm_project: --project-id is required

    So the block that fixes unrunnable instructions ended with an unrunnable
    instruction. It was caught by a reviewer running the list by hand, not by
    this suite, and "we ran it once" is not a property of the product. This

    project that is not the checkout and has never been initialized."""
