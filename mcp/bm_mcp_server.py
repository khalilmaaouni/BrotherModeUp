"""bm_mcp_server.py: a read-only Model Context Protocol server for one
BrotherMode project's store.

HOW "NEVER WRITES" IS ENFORCED, STRUCTURALLY, NOT BY PROMISE (BLOCKER 1,
final-blockers spec 2026-07-26, VERIFIED BY ORCHESTRATOR): a single
bm_status call against a store whose header bytes had been corrupted MOVED
the founder's store.sqlite3 aside into a quarantine directory and reported
isError: false, because bm_store.ReadOnlyStore's own corruption handling
(the right call for a WRITER, catastrophic for a READER) ran directly
against the real file; even the healthy path created -shm/-wal sidecars
that were not there a moment before. The fix removes the founder's real
files from the blast radius entirely rather than trusting any code path
inside bm_store.py to behave: every tool below first copies
`.brothermode/` and `STATE.md` from the real project root into a fresh,
private temporary directory (`_snapshot_for_reading`), runs every
bm_store.py call against THAT COPY, and deletes the copy before returning.
Whatever bm_store.py's own corruption handling, schema checks, or sidecar
creation do, including quarantining a file it decides is unreadable, they
now do it to bytes that are not the founder's, inside a directory this
file made and erases on every call, success or failure alike.

A read-only sqlite URI (mode=ro or immutable=1) was considered and
rejected on purpose, not merely left undone: bm_store.py's own GATE A
(fix-round 6, 2026-07-26) already found and closed a real defect where a
project path containing a '%' character was silently misread as a
DIFFERENT file, because sqlite's URI filename grammar percent-decodes the
whole path, not only its query string. Reusing a URI here to solve a
different problem risks reopening that exact class; copying the file
first avoids URIs altogether, which is why bm_store.py's own read-only
connection helper does the same.

Every database access in this file still goes through exactly two entry
points from `tools/bm_store.py`: `bm_store.ReadOnlyStore` (which refuses to
create a store that does not already exist, and enforces `PRAGMA
query_only=ON` on its connection) and `bm_store.verify()` (which itself
only opens a `ReadOnlyStore`) -- now always against the private copy
`_snapshot_for_reading` builds, never against the path a caller named.
This file adds no new query logic beyond simple in-memory filtering of
what `ReadOnlyStore.dump()` already returns, and calls no `Store` (the
writable class) anywhere; the one piece of machinery this file owns and
bm_store.py does not is the copy-then-discard snapshot itself.

WHAT THIS SERVER ANSWERS, matching the four questions ratified for the
read-only project server: what work is active, what fences (claimed file
paths) are live, what decisions were recorded, and whether the store is
healthy. Four tools, one each: bm_status, bm_active_work, bm_fences,
bm_decisions. Every founder-typed value this server returns -- a record
name, an objective, a tier, a claim path, a decision's topic or text, and
every `bm_store.verify()` problem line, which is a raw invariant-checker
string with no redaction of its own -- passes through
`bm_store._protect_text`, the exact function `tools/bm_store.py`'s own CLI
uses for its output (GATE 3, final-blockers spec 2026-07-26, VERIFIED BY
ORCHESTRATOR: a `verify()` problem naming a secret-shaped record reached a
client here completely unredacted while the CLI showed `[REDACTED]` for
the identical value, because `verify()` is an invariant checker, not a
rendering funnel, and this file used to print its problem strings
straight through with no funnel of its own).

project_root is REQUIRED and MUST be an absolute path (GATE 4, final-
blockers spec 2026-07-26, VERIFIED BY ORCHESTRATOR: a relative
project_root used to resolve against THIS SERVER PROCESS's own working
directory, which a caller neither sets nor sees, and the BROTHERMODE_ROOT
environment variable silently overrode an explicit argument outright, so a
call naming one project answered with a different project's record and no
sign anything had substituted). This server therefore never calls
`bm_store.resolve_root` (which checks BROTHERMODE_ROOT first): it walks up
from the given absolute path for a `.brothermode` marker, then a `.git`
directory, reusing `bm_store._walk_up` (a private but pure helper) rather
than reimplementing tree-walking a second time, and every tool names the
project root it actually resolved in its own first line of output, so a
substitution can never be silent.

HONESTY ABOUT SCOPE. This implements the subset of the Model Context
Protocol (2025-06-18) a read-only query tool over stdio actually needs:
the `initialize` handshake, the `notifications/initialized` notification,
`ping`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`. It does NOT implement resources,
prompts, sampling, elicitation, roots, pagination cursors, or any
`listChanged` notification (the tool list here is fixed at process start
and never changes, so there is nothing to notify about). This is a
deliberate, minimal cut, not an accidental gap; `mcp/README.md` says so
again and states plainly what has and has not been verified end to end
with a real MCP client. It also does not implement a crash-safe snapshot:
copying `.brothermode/` while another process is actively writing to it
(WAL mode) is a best-effort "hot copy", not a transactionally guaranteed
one; a snapshot taken mid-write can itself read back as busy or corrupted
on the COPY, which this server reports honestly rather than retrying
silently, and which never touches the real store either way.

Standard library only: json, os, sys, shutil, tempfile, contextlib,
importlib.util. No MCP SDK, no network library, no subprocess. The stdio
transport this implements is exactly what the spec defines it to be:
newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 messages on stdin/stdout, UTF-8, one message
per line, nothing else ever written to stdout. Confirmed against
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports
and the adjoining lifecycle and tools pages on 2026-07-26; this header
records that check rather than asking a reader to trust an unstated memory
of the spec.
