# Correction learning, explained plainly

Written 2026-07-29, Loop 13 of the correction-learning program. This is the
plain-language companion to the technical record in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-28-correction-learning-program.md` and
`docs/NOT-FINALIZED.md`. If a sentence here and a sentence in one of those two
disagrees, those two win: this file explains, it does not redefine.

Every command shown below was actually run against a real, throwaway store
while writing this file (built fresh under `/tmp`, then deleted), not copied
from a spec. Its exact output is quoted.

## What this is, in one sentence

A place on your own disk where a correction you give Claude, once you approve
it, is written down as a rule, and where Claude is required to check that list
before doing substantial work, so the same correction does not have to be
given twice.

Approved product wording for this system: "founder-approved correction
memory", "evidence-backed learned rules", "retrieval and outcome tracking",
"local correction-learning system". It is deliberately NOT described as
autonomous self-improvement, as statistical learning, as a guarantee against
repeated corrections, or as production ready. None of those claims is
supported yet, and section "What this does not claim" below says why.

## What is actually built right now

Everything below exists in this repository, is covered by the test suite, and
was exercised by hand for this document.

- **Capture.** You (or, soon, an automatic detector, see below) write down a
  correction: what situation it applies to, what to do instead, and why.
  Nothing changes yet, it is only a candidate.

  ```
  $ python3 tools/bm_learn.py capture --trigger "pushing commits or publishing a branch to GitHub" --action "use the GitHub Desktop app, never a bare git push" --because "the founder wants every push visible on screen" --scope global
  captured caf81782 (pending, nothing changes until you approve it)
  ```

- **Approval, and only your approval.** A candidate becomes a rule only when
  you say so. Nothing in this system, automatic capture included, can approve
  itself. That is not a policy choice that could be relaxed later, it is a
  hard rule this codebase enforces.

  ```
  $ python3 tools/bm_learn.py approve caf81782 --gate --ref "why you approved"
  approved as rule f9464c03
    f9464c03  [global, approved, gate] v1
       When: pushing commits or publishing a branch to GitHub
       Do  : use the GitHub Desktop app, never a bare git push
  ```

- **Retrieval, with the reason shown.** Two separate verbs, on purpose. `lookup`
  reads what rules apply to a piece of work and shows why each one matched; it
  writes nothing. `apply` does the same retrieval AND records that the rules
  were surfaced, so it needs a work identity (a session plus a claimed or
  provisional work record) and always attempts to record. Use `lookup` for
  exploration or to check whether a task even warrants the recorded path; use
  `apply` for substantial work. The old `relevant` still runs, kept as a
  deprecated alias that prints this on every call:

  ```
  $ python3 tools/bm_learn.py relevant --query "test"
  bm_learn: `relevant` is DEPRECATED and will be removed in the next major
  version. It is now an alias: use `lookup` to read without recording, or
  `apply --session ID` to do substantial work, which always records.
  ```

  ```
  $ python3 tools/bm_learn.py lookup --query "I want to push this branch to github"

  Soft rules: 0 shown, none omitted.
  ```

  Retrieval is honestly labelled `mode=lexical`: it matches on shared words,
  the same technique a good search box uses. It is not an AI judging
  relevance, and that is stated in the output itself, not only in this
  document.

  Since Loop P7 there is a second, OPTIONAL mode. `BROTHERMODE_FTS5=1` builds a
  SQLite full-text index over the fields that were already being shown to the
  model (trigger, action, because, domain, scope key) and adds two things: word
  stemming, so a rule about "pushing" is found by a task that says "pushed",
  and a BM25 component in the ranking. `BROTHERMODE_NO_FTS5=1` forces it back
  off. It is off by default on purpose: the lexical path is complete on its own,
  and a ranking number the founder cannot re-derive by hand should be something
  you switch on, not something you discover. Every result says which mode
  answered, and `bm25` is printed only when a real index did.

  ```
  $ python3 tools/bm_learn.py index-status
  search index: mode=lexical
    requested: no     available: no
    retrieval is lexical, which is complete on its own.
    turn the fast path on with BROTHERMODE_FTS5=1 (off again with BROTHERMODE_NO_FTS5=1)
  ```

  When the index is on, `bm_learn.py verify` compares it against the rules and
  reports any disagreement (a rule with no row, a row with no rule, a row
  pinned to an old version, text that does not match the version it names).
  `bm_learn.py rebuild-index` rebuilds it atomically.

- **Skill-driven retrieval (Loop 11A).** `SKILL.md` requires a Claude session
  to run retrieval before substantial work and to name which rule IDs it
  applied. This is "Stage A": the skill pulls rules, nothing pushes them at
  you automatically yet (see Loop 11B below).

- **Conflict detection and supersession (Loop 6).** Approving a rule that
  plainly reverses a live rule ("always push through the desktop app" against
  "never push through the desktop app") is refused unless you override it, and
  the override is recorded, not silent. `bm_learn.py verify` reports integrity
  problems (contradictions, a dead successor, and similar) with an exit code a
  script can act on: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 could not run.

  ```
  $ python3 tools/bm_learn.py verify
  learning-verify: 1 rule(s), 0 edge(s), 9 check(s) run
    note: fts-drift: no search index is enabled (BROTHERMODE_FTS5=1 turns it on), retrieval mode is lexical, so there is nothing to drift from
    no findings
  ```

  This detector is lexical, on purpose stated as a limit rather than a
  surprise: it catches a reversal of the same instruction, it does not catch
  "indent with tabs" against "indent with four spaces". You can always declare
  a conflict by hand with `bm_learn.py link a contradicts b`, and a declared
  conflict counts the same as a detected one everywhere downstream.

- **Retrieval and application outcomes (Loop 7).** Every rule shown to a
  session can be marked followed, ignored, not relevant, or unknown, so the
  store can answer "was the rule actually followed" rather than only "was it
  shown".

- **Grading with rework and escaped defects (Loop 8).** If a piece of work had
  to be redone, or a defect escaped a record you had already called done, that
  outcome can be recorded and linked to whichever rule applied to that work.

  ```
  $ python3 tools/bm_learn.py outcome ef85f24f --kind rework --note "had to redo the push because it went through git push directly" --artifact x.py
  captured 52878111 from rework (pending, nothing changes until you approve it)

    rules never retrieved: 1
    rules always marked not relevant: 0
    rework and escaped defects linked to a rule: 0
    unattributed outcomes (listed separately, never averaged in): 1
      52878111 rework: no rule application was recorded for that work, so this outcome is attributed to no rule
    NOT MEASURED: no rule application falls in this window, so every class below is not measured rather than zero
  ```

  Notice what that output does NOT do: it does not turn zero applications into
  a false "everything is fine" reading. Every line it cannot support says so
  (`NOT MEASURED`) instead of printing a zero that would read as a clean bill
  of health. A rework or an escaped defect is never counted as "you repeated
  yourself": you did not say anything twice, the work went wrong, and those
  are graded and reported on their own line so the two are never confused.

- **Multi-language capture (Loop 4).** Correction detection now recognises
  English, French and Japanese phrasing, and a long correction is excerpted
  with the omitted character count recorded rather than silently dropped, as
  the old English-only, 400-character filter used to do.

  ```
  $ python3 tools/bm_learn.py capture --trigger "quand on ecrit du code" --action "toujours ecrire des tests" --because "le fondateur veut de la fiabilite" --scope global
  captured ddd6e256 (pending, nothing changes until you approve it)
  ```

- **A stronger secret scrubber, and full withholding of raw founder text
  (Loop 12).** Every vendor-shaped secret pattern (an OpenAI-style key, an AWS
  key, a GitHub token, a French national ID number, and others) is now
  anchored so a secret glued to a word character on either side is still
  caught, which an earlier version of the scrubber missed. `dump` and every
  JSON-emitting command now withhold the raw founder text and evidence
  excerpts entirely, through one shared rule, rather than printing them
  because a particular command forgot to ask.

- **A result limit can no longer hide a gate rule (Loop P4).** `--limit` now
  caps SOFT rules only. Every applicable live gate rule is returned whatever
  the limit says, including `--limit 0` and negative limits, which both mean
  "gates only". Before this, a gate was exempt from the relevance floor but
  still subject to the slice, so a wordier soft rule could outrank it and a
  small limit cut it off entirely. The output now states the two facts
  separately, because they are two different things: gate delivery is a
  guarantee, soft omission is a tuning knob.

  ```
  $ python3 tools/bm_learn.py lookup --query "deploying the website to production" --limit 0
  MANDATORY FOUNDER GATES - 1 ACTIVE

  RELEVANT FOUNDER RULES (mode=lexical)

    of those: 0 shown in full (bounded per call), 1 in the compact manifest only. Pull one by id with --expand.
  Soft rules: 0 shown, 1 omitted by --limit 0. Raise the limit to see them.
  ```

  The JSON form carries the same numbers as `gates_returned`, `gates_total`,
  `soft_returned` and `soft_omitted`. Retiring a gate still works: a
  deprecated or forgotten gate is not live, so it is not delivered.

- **An empty screen says WHY it is empty (fix round P4-fix).** Zero results has
  two causes that used to print the same sentence: nothing matched, or rules
  matched and the limit cut every one of them. The first shipped wording said
  "none matched" either way and, on the path that returns early, never printed
  the omission count at all, so `--limit 0` in a store with a matching rule read
  as a clean complete answer while the JSON from the same call reported the
  omission. The two causes are now distinguishable, and the gate sentence and
  the soft sentence are printed on every path out of the command.

  ```
  $ python3 tools/bm_learn.py lookup --query "deploying the website to production" --limit 0

  ```

## Anchored notes, and the alert that can refuse an approval

Storage schema 7 adds one table, `notes`: an anchored row carrying a kind
(`insight`, `alert`, `question`, `review`, `todo`, `risk`), a severity where one
applies, its author, the file, candidate, rule, record or decision it is
anchored to, and its body. Notes are written by people, never generated.
Schema 8 adds one column to that table, `anchor_line_hash`, described under
"Where an anchored line went" below.

One kind has teeth. An UNRESOLVED `alert` at severity `critical`, anchored to a
candidate, to the work record that candidate came from, or to any file that
candidate's approval would change, REFUSES the approval. The refusal names the
alert, its author and its anchor, and it fires both when the approval receipt is
minted and when it is spent, so an alert raised after the founder answered still
stops the rule being created. An alert anchored to a rule or to a decision is
recorded and rendered at its anchor but refuses nothing by itself, and the
command that writes it says so rather than promising teeth it does not have.

### Where an anchored line went

A note anchored to a file AND a line records a fingerprint of that line when it
is written (schema 8, `notes.anchor_line_hash`), and every surface that renders
notes reports where the line is now: still there, moved to a different line
number, no longer in the file, or in a file that could not be read. A note whose
line has moved is REPORTED, never dropped and never edited, in
`bm_learn.py notes`, in the generated documentation, and in a gate pack.

Two write-time refusals come with it. A line past the end of the file is
refused (`anchor-line-out-of-range`), because a note nobody can follow to a line
is a note nobody can act on. A line that cannot be fingerprinted (the file could
not be read, or the line is blank) is NOT refused: the note is kept, the command
says the anchor is untracked, and the reports call it unverifiable rather than
pretending it was checked.

```
$ python3 tools/bm_learn.py note --kind risk --severity warning \
    --author "Dana, backend" --anchor file:api/pay.py --line 99 \
    --body "the refund path has no idempotency key"
refused (anchor-line-out-of-range): api/pay.py has 6 line(s), so there is no
line 99 to anchor a note to.

$ python3 tools/bm_learn.py notes
7dfdc389  risk     warning   open     file:api/pay.py:5  by Dana, backend
     the refund path has no idempotency key
     ANCHOR MOVED: the anchored line moved from line 5 to line 9
```

Lineage is a query rather than a stored field: everything that touched a
decision, in order, with authors. It joins the capture, the notes anchored to
the candidate, to the resulting rule, to the work record and to the decision
itself, the approval receipts and the rule that came out. It is rendered in
`Documentation/30-decisions/INDEX.md` and carried in `facts.json`.

An identifier anchor is resolved when the note is written: the prefix you type
becomes the full uuid it names, or the write is refused because it names nothing
(`anchor-not-found`) or more than one thing (`ambiguous-anchor`). Both refusals
exist because of the same failure: an alert nobody can match is an alert whose
author believes a gate is held while nothing is held, and a one-character anchor
used to stand in front of every gate in the project.

```
$ python3 tools/bm_learn.py note --kind alert --severity critical \
    --author "Dana, backend" --anchor file:api/pay.py --line 42 \
    --body "the retry path double charges; do not lock this in yet"
$ python3 tools/bm_learn.py grant-approval a8815578 --answer "yes do it" ...
refused (unresolved-critical-alert): a critical alert is unresolved and stands
in front of this approval: Dana, backend wrote 'the retry path double charges;
do not lock this in yet' about file api/pay.py (note 25eb0c4f). Resolve it, or
re-run with an explicit override reason. 1 unresolved critical alert(s) match
this approval.
```

Two ways past it, and neither of them is a delete. `resolve-note` records what
answered the alert. `--override-alerts "<reason>"` on grant-approval and approve
proceeds anyway: the reason is recorded on the alert row with the founder's own
reference, the alert stays visible as overridden and stays unresolved, and the
override is part of the approval fingerprint, so a receipt minted for a clean
question cannot be spent with an override attached. There is no delete for a
note anywhere in the code.

An override is PER GATE, not a switch on the alert. The alert is still
unresolved, so it stands in front of the next approval that touches its anchor
too, and that refusal says when it was overridden before and with what reason.
Anything else would mean one recorded override at one gate silently disarming a
concern nobody ever answered, for every later gate in the project, including the
gates that were never told the alert existed.

The change set the refusal uses is what the store recorded: the claimed paths of
the work record the candidate came from, plus the scope key when the scope is an
artifact. A file nothing claimed is a file no alert can guard, and a generated
gate pack says so beside the excerpt rather than leaving it implied.

## Gate deep-dive packs

`tools/bm_packs.py` writes one document per decision, on demand, for a human who
has to approve it and has not read the transcript. Nothing is generated until
asked: `stakes` prints the single line a question window carries plus the path
the pack would occupy, and `pack` writes it.

```
$ python3 tools/bm_packs.py stakes a8815578
$ python3 tools/bm_packs.py pack a8815578 --cite api/pay.py:40-58
$ python3 tools/bm_packs.py review a8815578 --by "Dana, backend" \
    --verdict concerns --notes "read the retry path" --residual "no test yet"
```

Eight sections: the decision in plain language and what happens if it is wrong,
the options with their trade-offs and the recommendation, the code as excerpts
quoted live from disk, the dependency map, the risks with the rollback commands,
what the store already knows, a mermaid diagram, and the review slots. A recorded
review is a row in the store, not only a line in a file.

Two properties are worth stating because they are what make the document
trustworthy rather than decorative. Every excerpt is re-read at generation time
and checked against the anchor and content hash recorded the last time the pack
was written, so a citation whose lines moved, or whose body changed underneath a
stable anchor, FAILS generation and names the remedy; a pack never quietly quotes
code that is no longer there. And anything written between the human markers in
the document survives regeneration byte for byte.

Byte for byte means byte for byte, including the two ways it used not to. The
secret scrubber every generated file is written through is not run over a human
block, because it is a pattern scrubber and "the DB password: ask Sam" came back
as "the DB [REDACTED] Sam"; when a line in a block does look secret shaped, the
command says which line and leaves it alone. And a `bm-cite` comment inside a
human block is prose, not configuration: an excerpt header pasted into a review
note used to become a citation of the pack, which either added a code excerpt
nobody asked for or refused every future regeneration until somebody edited the
one part of the file that is supposed to be untouchable.

## What this does not claim, and why

- **Not autonomous self-improvement.** Every rule that changes anything went
  through your approval. Automatic detection (below) finds candidates, it
  never promotes them.
- **Not statistical learning from a small number of sessions.** A person has
  perhaps twenty to forty rules. There is no dataset here large enough to
  train or validate anything, and the program deliberately does not pretend
  otherwise (see "Loops deliberately not built" below).
- **Not a guarantee against repeated corrections.** The system can now tell
  you when a correction repeats one you already settled, and why (never
  retrieved, retrieved and skipped, retrieved into the wrong work, or followed
  and wrong anyway), but it cannot promise a correction is never needed twice.
- **Not correctness judged by an LLM.** Retrieval relevance is lexical word
  matching, stated as such in its own output. Grading rework and escaped
  defects is something you or an external process records, not a judgment the
  model makes about its own work.
- **Not production ready before dogfooding.** See the next section.

## What automatic capture does, and does not do

An automatic detector watches for correction-shaped messages at the end of a
session and files them as pending candidates. It runs in English, French and
Japanese, and a long message is excerpted rather than dropped. It has never,
under any configuration, been given the ability to approve what it finds.
Approval requires a human-confirmed, one-time receipt-gated answer, always:
that is a hard rule in the code, not a setting. The receipt proves an answer
was supplied for this exact proposed rule and has not already been used; it
does not cryptographically prove which human supplied the answer.

The detector is a set of phrase patterns, not language understanding. A
correction phrased in a way none of the packs recognise is still missed, and
the honest name for that is a recall gap, not a bug that will be quietly
fixed by more patterns. `bm_learn.py capture` covers any language, by hand,
regardless of what the detector recognises.

## The biggest honest gap: this has never run on a real day of work

Every number, every command output, and every test in this document and in
this codebase comes from a test suite, an adversarial probe against a
throwaway store, or a scripted demonstration. **Not one hour of the founder's
actual work has gone through this system.** That is `docs/NOT-FINALIZED.md`
item 1, marked UNPROVEN and ranked as the highest-harm open item in the whole
project, and it stays UNPROVEN here too. Only using the system for real,
across real working days (Loop 14a in the program), closes it. No amount of
further testing can.

## What was deliberately not built, and why

- **Loop 9, evaluation partitions and deterministic replay.** Not built,
  reopen when the rule corpus is large enough for a train/validation/test
  split to decide anything. At twenty to forty rules for one person, a
  validation partition would hold about eight cases, and a statistically
  significant result over eight cases does not exist. Building the machinery
  anyway would make an unsupportable number look rigorous, which is the exact
  failure this program's own principle (delete or relabel a metric that
  cannot move mechanically or cannot support a decision at current volume)
  forbids.
- **Loop 10, generated LESSONS and TOOLBOX views.** Not built, reopen when
  hand-curating `docs/knowledge/LESSONS.md` and `docs/knowledge/TOOLBOX.md`
  actually becomes the bottleneck. Both files already hold good, hand-written
  content that no code reads; generating over them today would destroy real
  work rather than replace a real problem.
- **Loop 11B, the optional automatic-retrieval hook.** Not built. Stage A
  (the skill pulling rules on its own initiative, already shipped) has to be
  dogfooded first. A hook that pushes the wrong rule into every single prompt
  is worse than the current, opt-in retrieval, and this is explicitly gated
  on the real dogfood window (Loop 14a), not a technical blocker.

None of the three is abandoned. Each has a stated, checkable reopening
condition rather than a vague "later".

## Independent review: still open

`docs/NOT-FINALIZED.md` item 12 records that an independent second-model
adversarial re-audit of this project has never run. The privacy and security
work in Loop 12 (the scrubber fix and the withholding fix described above)
does **not** close that item: it was written and verified by the same model
family that built the feature it is reviewing, which is exactly the blind
spot an independent re-audit exists to catch. Item 12 stays open until a
different model family runs an adversarial pass against this system.

## Windows

Every claim about this system's behaviour on Windows comes from continuous
integration, never from a machine on this desk. There is no Windows machine
available to the people building this. Where CI is green on Windows, that is
what "supported" rests on; where a limit says "POSIX only" (recovered work
being owner-only, for example), it is because Windows uses access control
lists rather than POSIX file modes and this project does not yet set one.

## Replacing the old scorecard's theatre metrics

The pre-existing weekly scorecard (`RUBRIC.md` metric 1, "SELF-LEARNING") is a
founder-frozen template: `RUBRIC.md` says its own numbers change only by
founder decision, never by drift, so this document does not silently rewrite
it. What changed is the evidence available to score it against. Where the old
metric had no mechanical number behind it, `bm_learn.py loop-failures` and
`bm_learn.py rule-outcomes` now produce one, built from rows that exist in the
store rather than from a self-report:

- candidates captured, and founder approval/rejection counts (`candidates`,
  `bm_learn.py metrics`);
- repeated settled corrections, reported separately from rework and escaped
  defects, never folded together (`loop-failures`);
- retrieval misses, compliance failures, bad-rule candidates, and scope
  errors (`loop-failures`, four separate named counts, not one blended
  score);
- unresolved contradictions, rules never retrieved, and rules retrieved but
  always marked not relevant (`loop-failures`, `verify`);
- rework and escaped defects linked to a rule, with unattributed outcomes
  listed on their own line, never averaged into a rule's record
  (`loop-failures`);
- `NOT MEASURED` printed in place of any number the rows on hand cannot
  support, rather than a zero that would read as a clean result.

Any count this system cannot yet produce (a felt-outcome average with real
provenance, for instance) is not invented here. If you want `RUBRIC.md`
itself amended to point metric 1 at these commands, that is a founder
decision the rubric's own rule reserves to you; this document only makes the
evidence available.
