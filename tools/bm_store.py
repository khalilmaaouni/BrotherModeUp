"""BrotherMode V2 engine core: the ONE transactional store every ownership
mutation goes through (Decision 2, ratified spec 2026-07-26). Nothing else in
this project is allowed to be the source of truth for who owns what work.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  The V1 registries (bm_registry.py plus hand-maintained STATE.md prose) let
  two sessions each believe they held a fence over the same files (F1, F2,
  F11), let a second session silently take over a name someone else was
  actively working under (F3), let two handovers collide on a truncated
  fingerprint and drop the second one (F13), and could not tell a healthy
  empty registry from one a crash had truncated to nothing (F9). None of
  those were one-off bugs: they were the shape you get from a JSON file
  guarded by an advisory lock, asked to also behave like a transactional
  ledger. sqlite3 in WAL mode, one lifecycle_uuid per unit of work that is
  NEVER reused, and two explicit, opposite failure policies close the whole
  class at once rather than patching each instance as it resurfaces.

THE CONTRACT
  - ONE CANONICAL ROOT: resolve_root() walks BROTHERMODE_ROOT, then markers,
    then .git, in that order, never os.getcwd() alone.
  - ONE TRANSACTIONAL STORE: this module is the only writer of
    <root>/.brothermode/store.sqlite3. STATE.md is a GENERATED view, never
    hand-edited truth: render_state_md/write_state_view regenerate it and
    leave any human prose outside its markers untouched.
  - ONE IMMUTABLE IDENTITY: every record's lifecycle_uuid is permanent and
    reused by nothing; every mutation names an expected_version and fails
    CLOSED (StaleIdentity) the moment that version no longer matches.
  - TWO FAILURE POLICIES, EXPLICIT: ownership and lifecycle mutations here
    refuse rather than guess (OwnershipRefused, StaleIdentity, StoreCorrupt).
    The render functions (render_digest, render_state_md, dump) are the
    advisory exception on purpose: handed a missing record they degrade to a
    plain "(no such record)" string instead of raising, because a display
    function that crashes a session over stale digest text is a worse
    failure than one ugly line of output.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network, no subprocess. That claim now
covers strictly more code than it used to, and it was kept DELIBERATELY when
FINDING 5 needed git's real state: root resolution walks the filesystem
directly, and the git containment check reads git's own on-disk files
(.git/index, .gitignore, .git/info/exclude) and parses them here in pure
Python rather than shelling out to `git ls-files` or `git check-ignore`.
Three reasons, all of them load-bearing:
  * bm_telemetry.py loads this module by path and documents that doing so
    "keeps this module's own no-subprocess property intact"; SECURITY.md
    publishes that property and a mechanical test in test_bm.py enforces it
    per file. An import here would silently break all three at once.
  * this check runs on EVERY store open, including inside a repository the
    founder did not create, and executing a PATH-resolved binary from that
    position is a bigger surface than reading four files.
  * a subprocess that cannot be spawned (no git on PATH, a locked-down hook
    environment) gives an "unknown" answer that a security check has to
    treat as a refusal anyway, so the dependency buys nothing.
The cost is stated where it is paid: see _git_index_tracked_paths and
_git_ignore_decision for exactly which git behaviours are implemented and
which are deliberately not.

    """Quote a path for the shell the READER is actually holding.

    FOUND BY CI, 2026-07-31, and it was a real defect in shipped instruction
    text rather than a test artifact. `shlex.quote` implements POSIX shell
    quoting and nothing else. A Windows path is full of backslashes, none of
    which are in shlex's safe set, so `shlex.quote(r"C:\\Users\\x\\bm_store.py")`
    returns that path wrapped in SINGLE QUOTES. The remedy this project prints
    to a Windows user therefore read `python3 'C:\\Users\\...'`, which neither
    cmd.exe nor PowerShell will run: both treat the single quote as part of the
    filename. Every user-facing instruction in bm_docs, bm_packs and bm_learn
    flows through invocation(), so one wrong quoting rule broke all of them on
    one platform.

    The two shells disagree, so the answer has to depend on where the reader is:
    POSIX keeps shlex; Windows gets double quotes, and only when the path
    contains a space, because cmd and PowerShell both accept a bare path
    otherwise and an unnecessarily quoted one is noise a reader has to undo.

    WIDENED 2026-07-31 after checking the first version against external ground
    truth, and the first version was WRONG. It quoted only on a space or a double
    quote, which let ordinary Windows paths through bare that cmd.exe does not
    read as one word:

        C:\\R&D\\tools\\bm_store.py      ->  & is a command separator
        C:\\temp\\100%\\bm_store.py      ->  % begins a variable reference
        C:\\a!b\\bm_store.py             ->  ! is delayed expansion

    `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\...` survived only because it also has a space; its
    parentheses are metacharacters too. These are not exotic paths, and the
    command this project prints is one a human is invited to paste.

    The character set below is taken from mslex, the package that exists because
    the standard library declines this job ("shlex for windows"), whose cmd rule
    quotes on whitespace or any of " ^ & | < > ( ) % !. Python's own shlex
    documentation states the constraint that makes this necessary: "The shlex
    module is only designed for Unix shells. The quote() function is not
    guaranteed to be correct on non-POSIX compliant shells or shells from other
    operating systems such as Windows."

    Not a dependency on mslex: this project is standard library only, so the rule
    is reimplemented and its source named, which is also why the tests below
    encode mslex's documented cases rather than this function's own opinion.

    Any whitespace counts, not just a space, because a tab in a path splits an
    argument exactly as a space does."""

    Order matters and is deliberate: BROTHERMODE_ROOT always wins because a
    human or a script set it on purpose. Failing that, a marker directory
    ANYWHERE up the tree beats a closer .git, so once `init` has run, a
    nested .git (a submodule, a vendored dependency) can never shadow the
    real project root (fixes F2 / F42 / the F2b class).

    refuse_past_git_boundary (FINDING 11, MEDIUM) is OPT-IN and defaults
    OFF, which is the whole point. The precedence above is CORRECT for the
    bug class it was written for, and simply preferring the nearest .git
    would reopen F2 / F42 / F2b, so this does NOT change the ordering for
    anybody. What it adds is a second, requestable question: does the root
    this resolver picked sit ABOVE a nearer git boundary, meaning the
    caller is standing in a repository of its own that would silently
    attach to a DIFFERENT parent project's store?

    bm_autosave.py discovered that question privately (see
    _resolve_receipt_root there: "resolve_root(toplevel) can walk UP PAST
    this snapshot's own git toplevel") and carries its own copy of the
    check. A private copy is a check the next consumer does not get, so it
    lives here now and every consumer can ask for it.

    When it fires, this REFUSES rather than picking a side: choosing the
    nearer .git reopens the vendored-submodule bug, choosing the further
    marker is the cross-project attachment being reported, and guessing
    between two defensible answers is what got this class of bug shipped
    twice already. The refusal names BROTHERMODE_ROOT, which is the
    explicit answer.

    Source "env" is exempt on purpose: BROTHERMODE_ROOT IS the explicit
    root the refusal asks for, so checking it against the filesystem would
    turn the only remedy into another dead end. A caller that also needs to
    validate an explicitly-set root against its own expectations (as
    bm_autosave does, comparing against its snapshot's toplevel) still has
    to do that itself; this parameter does not cover it.

    env_must_contain_start (H3, cross-family review 2026-08-08, finding 2)
    is likewise OPT-IN and defaults OFF. The hooks pass it: an inherited
    BROTHERMODE_ROOT naming a tree UNRELATED to the work in front of a hook
    used to win outright, redirecting the fence to a foreign store whose
    empty claim table read as 'nothing fenced here', while the real
    project's claims went unconsulted. With this flag, the env answer is
    honored only when the effective start sits inside (or is) the env
    root; otherwise the env answer is skipped and resolution continues
    from start exactly as if the variable were unset, so the fence stays
    live on the store that actually owns the write. CLI and test callers,
    where pointing at a project from anywhere is the documented use of the
    variable, keep the old trust by default."""

    declared claims name the same file", which is symmetric, and that is
    the right question for a FENCE, where either side touching the other's
    files is a conflict. An authorisation boundary is not a fence: the only
    question allowed_paths asks is whether the thing being checked falls
    inside it. Asked symmetrically, a caller declaring the PARENT of an
    allowed path overlapped it and was ALLOWED, so it received
    authorisation over every sibling the same contract refuses when that
    sibling is named directly. Containment is one-directional and cannot be
    widened that way. paths_overlap keeps its own semantics untouched; this
    is a second, narrower question, not a replacement.

    '.' is the canonical whole root (see _to_posix and canonicalize_path).
    On the ALLOWED side it still contains everything, which is exactly what
    a whole-project contract grants. On the CANDIDATE side it is contained
    by nothing except '.' itself, so a request to write the whole project
    is authorised only by a contract that granted the whole project.

    A glob on the ALLOWED side is DEPTH EXACT and is matched segment by
    segment (fix round 2026-08-05, REFUTATION-3 AZ F-A2). It used to reduce
    to its coverage key, the literal prefix directory it claims, which is
    the right reduction for a FENCE (paths_overlap still uses it) and much
    too wide for a boundary: ['api/*.py'] then admitted the directory 'api'
    itself, every file under it at ANY depth ('api/sub/deep/secrets.env'),
    and, because a leading wildcard reduces to the EMPTY prefix which
    _prefix_contains treats as the root, ['*.py'] admitted the WHOLE
    project, terraform state and env file included. Under the rule below a
    glob grants exactly what it matches at its own depth: same segment
    count, every segment matching its own pattern segment. The recursive
    spelling is the plain directory, which the containment branch above
    already handles, so '**' is not recursive here and 'api/**' admits only
    the direct children of 'api'.

    AND IT MUST ALSO GRANT WHAT A FENCE OVER THE MATCH WOULD COVER
    (FOUNDER DECISION, 2026-08-05). Depth-exact matching alone left the
    hole AZ reproduced fourth: ['src/*'] matched the plain DIRECTORY
    'src/app' at its own depth, and a fence over a directory covers its
    whole SUBTREE (paths_overlap and _coverage_key, which the fence hook
    calls), so 'src/app/deep/keys.pem' became writable through the fence
    although this very function REFUSES it when it is named directly. An
    authorisation that grants a name whose fence reaches further than the
    grant is not a boundary. So the rule gained its second half: an entry
    grants a candidate ONLY IF it also grants everything a fence over that
    candidate would cover. A pattern grants nothing below its own depth,
    therefore a pattern may grant only a candidate with no subtree,
    therefore a pattern may grant only a FILE, and the only file signal a
    lexical boundary has is the extension the final segment carries (see
    _names_a_file). 'src/*' still grants 'src/a.py' and no longer grants
    'src/app'; 'api/*.py' is untouched, because every name it can match
    carries '.py'.

    The two rejected alternatives, both measured, both in
    docs/program/absolute-lead/evidence/L03/FIX-round5-store-report.md
    section 3 with their verbatim failures: a pattern granting the SUBTREE
    of everything it matches reinstates the whole-project grant (['*']
    authorises every file at every depth again), and a pattern granting
    NOTHING breaks ['api/*.py'], which is a legitimate founder allowance.
    This rule only ever narrows: every path it refuses today was granted
    yesterday, and nothing it grants today was refused yesterday.

    The teachable one-liner: a plain path grants its subtree, a pattern
    grants the FILES it matches at its own depth. Name the directory
    literally when the subtree is what you mean.

    fnmatch.fnmatchCASE, never fnmatch.fnmatch: the latter applies
    os.path.normcase itself, which on win32 IS ntpath.normcase and rewrites
    '/' to '\\', the exact defect _normcase's GATE 2 comment documents

    coercion above, and then the rule that a write scope is a LITERAL PATH,
    never a pattern (fix round 2026-08-05, REFUTATION-4 AZ F1 and F3).

    Why the declaration side and not the matching side. The two sides of an
    authorisation are not symmetric. `allowed_paths` is the FOUNDER drawing
    a boundary, and a pattern is a reasonable way to draw one, so
    'api/*.py' keeps working there and path_within_allowed keeps matching
    it depth-exactly. `write_scope` is a WORKER naming what it is about to
    change, and the same string is read three more times afterwards by
    machinery that reduces it to its literal prefix directory: the fence
    claim, tools/bm_fence_hook.py's covering check (through paths_overlap
    and _coverage_key), and the engine's `git restore --` rollback, where
    git's own pathspec globbing is recursive. Round 4 narrowed the FIRST
    reader and left the other three, so a unit that declared '*.py' was
    authorised, fenced and rolled back over the WHOLE project (the literal
    prefix of a leading wildcard is the empty string, which
    _prefix_contains treats as the root). Narrowing one reader and leaving
    the rest is what produced the hole; refusing the pattern where it
    ENTERS the store closes it for every reader at once, and does it in a
    way a founder can act on: name the files.

    The same refusal also removes F3's bypass primitive. canonicalize_path
    resolves only the literal prefix of a glob, so nothing under a wildcard
    is ever realpath'd; 'src/[a]pp' matches exactly one path, 'src/app',
    and was ALLOWED where naming that path refuses 'path-escape'. Any
    refused path could be re-spelled as a character class matching only
    itself. A pattern cannot be declared at all now, so there is no second
    spelling to find.

    ROUND 6 (fix round 2026-08-05, REFUTATION-5-safety.md S1, a
    PUSH-BLOCKER with two end to end reproductions that destroyed every
    uncommitted founder edit in a project). Refusing three METACHARACTERS
    was refusing a spelling, not stating the rule. Git has a SECOND way to
    mean more than one file and it uses none of those characters: PATHSPEC
    MAGIC, which always begins with a colon. Every spelling below survived
    the round-5 gate, was canonicalised as an ordinary relative name,
    stored, fenced, and handed to the engine's own
    `git restore -- <entry>`, and each is refused here for the reason
    beside it (behaviour measured against the system git, not assumed):

      ':'                  what ':/' CANONICALISES TO, and the spelling git
                           reads as the whole repository. The rollback
                           restored every tracked file and exited 0, so the
                           engine read it as SUCCESS and queued no
                           dirty-write-scope warning at all
      ':/'  ':(top)'       the repository root, short and long form: the
                           rollback reverts the whole working tree
      ':!x' ':^x'          exclude, short forms: the rollback reverts
      ':(exclude)x'        everything EXCEPT x, which is the exact opposite
                           of what a founder reading the plan sees named
      ':(icase)X'          matches a file this entry does not spell, so the
                           fence and the rollback disagree with the text
      ':(literal)x'        still MAGIC, not a path: the prefix has to go,
                           not just the dangerous-looking spellings
      ':(glob)x'           glob magic with no metacharacter in the string,
                           so the round-5 rule never sees it
      ':(attr:...)'        names a SET of files by attribute, no path in it
      '::'                 empty magic plus an empty path

    Two more shapes go with it, for the same reason (the string is read
    again by three readers that are not this one). An ABSOLUTE path either
    names another machine's tree or re-spells one inside this project:
    accepted before, and silently rewritten to its relative form, so the
    plan the founder wrote and the plan the store held were different
    strings. An EMPTY or whitespace-only entry names no file and used to
    reach canonicalize_path as a bare ValueError('empty path'), with no
    reason code, no unit id and no remedy.

    What is deliberately NOT refused: a colon anywhere other than the
    start. Pathspec magic is a PREFIX, so 'src/a:b.py' is an ordinary
    filename and refusing it would be this round over-reaching. And the
    ALLOWANCE side (a contract's allowed_paths) is untouched here as it was
    in round 5: that is a recorded founder decision.

    Public, not private, on purpose: any other caller that stores what a
    worker will WRITE (a fence claim built from a brief, a future scope
    field) should share this gate rather than grow a second copy of it.
    Store.claim's own `files` argument deliberately does NOT go through
    here: a fence claim is the symmetric question "can these two claims
    name the same file", where a glob is meaningful and where
    tools/test_bm_store.py's own glob-claim test pins the behaviour."""

    returns the canonical root-relative string that will be stored, or
    raises OwnershipRefused. No other exception type crosses it.

    Why the catch-all is not paranoia. canonicalize_path ends in
    os.path.realpath, which is a SYSCALL: it can raise OSError (a volume
    unmounted mid-plan, a permission wall, ELOOP on some platforms),
    ValueError (an embedded NUL, platform dependent) or anything a hostile
    os.PathLike proxy chooses. Every one of those used to leave
    upsert_units as itself, straight past the ValueError-and-BMStoreError
    handler in `bm-controller plan`'s main(), as a traceback, out of a
    method whose whole contract is that it validates a plan BEFORE writing
    any of it. AZ F11 made the same argument for _coerce_path_entry one
    round earlier; this is the same rule applied to the resolver.

    An OwnershipRefused from inside is re-raised UNCHANGED, deliberately:
    'path-escape' is already a named refusal carrying the root it was
    measured against, and re-labelling it would cost the founder the one
    fact that tells them what to do.

    THE SECOND LOOK, and it is not belt and braces: it closes a bypass of
    this round's own fix, found by attacking the fix rather than the defect
    (the same shape F3 had one round earlier). The declaration rules read
    what the caller WROTE, which is right, because that is the string the
    refusal has to quote back. canonicalize_path then resolves '.' and
    '..' segments lexically and strips the string as a whole, so a
    DECLARATION the rules refuse can be re-spelled as one they accept:
    './:!keep.txt' is stored as ':!keep.txt', the git exclude spelling that
    reverts every file except the one it names; 'sub/../:' is stored as
    ':', the whole-repository one; './a:b' is stored as 'a:b', which a
    Windows caller reads as drive-qualified; './ /' is stored as ' ',
    whitespace only. A property sweep over 2954 generated spellings found
    those families and is pinned as a test, because reading
    canonicalize_path does not predict them. The stored string is what the
    fence, the coverage check and `git restore --` actually read, so it
    goes through the SAME rules, and the refusal names both forms: what

    The defect this closes is one missing question. `for p in (scope or

      S4, and it fails SILENTLY, which is why it is the dangerous one: a

    Guessing at a declaration is how S4's reproduction ended with a unit's

# The handover (schema 5, post-audit LOOP P12). What a row here means: at the
# moment a record changed lifecycle state, this is what the outgoing session was
# leaving behind for whoever picks the work up.
#
# WHY IT IS A TABLE AND NOT AN APPEND. Until this loop, bm_threads.py delivered
# a handover by APPENDING text to the project's root STATE.md under its own
# directory lock, while write_state_view independently read that same file,
# rebuilt it and atomically REPLACED it, taking no lock at all. Interleave the
# two and the append lands on a file the replace is about to overwrite: the
# record is parked, the handover text is gone, and nothing anywhere holds a
# second copy. Reproduced on 2026-07-29 against a real store before this change
# (record state 'parked', handover tag absent from STATE.md, no table to recover
# it from). The fix is not a bigger lock. It is that the handover and the
# lifecycle transition that produced it are ONE sqlite transaction, and STATE.md
# becomes a pure render of that truth which can be regenerated at any time.
#
# transition_id carries the atomicity claim in the schema itself: it is the
# rowid of the transitions row written by the SAME transaction, so a handover
# whose transition rolled back cannot exist, and a transition whose handover
# insert raised rolled back with it. The partial unique index on it means one
# transition can own at most one handover.
#
# payload_fingerprint is the store's own full 64-hex handover_payload
# fingerprint, and the retry dedupe is
# UNIQUE(lifecycle_uuid, payload_fingerprint, heading) WHERE delivered_at IS
# NULL: a second attempt at the same handover text for the same lifecycle,
# while the first copy is still on the founder's screen, loses on the index
# instead of writing the text twice. That replaces bm_threads' old trick of
# scanning a text file for an HTML comment marker.
#
# Fix round (2026-07-29): that index used to be UNIQUE(lifecycle_uuid,
# payload_fingerprint) over ALL rows, delivered or not, and that is a dedupe
# that deletes handovers rather than deduplicating text. The fingerprint covers
# objective, files, owner, tier, check, evidence, latest digest and decisions.
# It does NOT cover state, version, transition_id, heading or the session ids.
# So a record parked, acknowledged, resumed and parked again with no new
# checkpoint produced the identical fingerprint, the insert lost, the swallow
# hid it, and the second park had no handover ANYWHERE: no row, no STATE.md
# section, and `verify` reported healthy. Two changes make that unreachable.
# The index is now PARTIAL on delivered_at IS NULL, so an acknowledged row can
# never suppress a new one (the founder has already seen and dismissed it, and
# it no longer renders). And heading is part of the key, so a park heading the
# founder typed and the adoption heading that follows it are two different
# handovers instead of one, which is what stopped an adopted record from
# rendering under a stale "Drained from thread mode" header forever.
#
# body holds the rendered digest (already passed through redact_text by
# render_digest, which refuses rather than render unredacted text), and it is
# passed through _redacted_view_text AGAIN on the way into STATE.md like every
# other founder-typed field: the store file itself is documented as sensitive in
# SECURITY.md, the generated view is not.
#
# delivered_at is NULL until a founder acknowledges the handover
# (`handover-ack`). An undelivered handover renders into STATE.md on every
# regeneration, so a crash between the commit and the render costs nothing: the
# next render puts it back. Acknowledging is idempotent; it never deletes the

# Schema 8, phase C. ONE additive column: the fingerprint of the source line a
# file anchor points at, taken when the note was written.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Section 6 requires that a note anchored to a line that has
# SINCE MOVED be reported rather than silently dropped, and a line number alone
# cannot answer that question: line 5 of a file that still has 200 lines
# resolves to whatever sits at line 5 now, so a reviewer reads a note about code
# that has moved elsewhere as though it described the code in front of them.
# Reproduced against a real store before this column existed: a note anchored at
# api/pay.py:99 in a six line file was accepted, listed and rendered, and no
# command ever mentioned that the line did not exist.
#
# WHY A HASH RATHER THAN THE LINE ITSELF. Two reasons, in this order. The
# column would otherwise hold source text, which is the kind of content the
# export policy has to withhold, and the name chosen here ends in _hash, so
# export_column withholds it BY SHAPE with no list to remember (see
# _DUMP_DIGEST_SUFFIXES). And a fingerprint is all the resolver needs: it can
# say "still there", "now at line 41" or "no longer in the file" from a digest
# alone, which is exactly what a reviewer has to be told.
#
# DEFAULT ''. An empty fingerprint means "not recorded" (a note written before
# schema 8, a whole-file anchor with no line, or an anchored line that was
# blank), and bm_learning.resolve_anchor_line reports that state as
# unverifiable rather than pretending the anchor was checked.

# Schema 11 (LOOP 4, 2026-07-30): durable work identity for substantial

# no ALTER on any existing table), for the same reason schema 9 and schema
# 10 each had to add a table/columns rather than widen a constraint:
# learning_applications.record_uuid is already nullable and REFERENCES
# records(lifecycle_uuid) (since schema 2), and the founder's live store
# already holds application rows with NULL record_uuid. "every new apply
# needs a work identity" cannot be expressed as NOT NULL on that column
# without rewriting every existing row, so it is enforced at the command and
# API layer instead (bm_learn.py cmd_apply's own check, and
# record_learning_applications's require_record_identity guard below); the
# column stays exactly as nullable as it has always been.
#
# learning_retrieval_membership answers the question eligible_count cannot:
# WHICH rules, at WHAT version, were eligible for one retrieval. A count
# survives a rule swap (one forgotten, one approved, the total unchanged);
# a membership row for each does not, because it names rule_uuid and
# rule_version, never a tally. eligible_count is UNTOUCHED, still written and
# read exactly as schema 4 defined it (see :7400 and
# classify_learning_applications); this table is the reconstruction detail
# recorded ALONGSIDE it, never a replacement for it.
#
# provisional_records marks a SUBSET of ordinary records rows, rather than
# widening records.state's CHECK to add a 'provisional' value -- the exact
# trap named up front for this loop: SQLite cannot alter a CHECK constraint
# without a full table rebuild, the same wall schema 9 hit for state and
# schema 10 hit for shown_to_model. The underlying records row this table
# points at is completely ordinary (state 'active', lifetime 'ephemeral', no
# claimed files), so every existing mechanism -- fences, dashboard,
# transition() -- already works on it for free. This table is only the
# ledger of which records rows started life provisional, and when each was

# The Memory Sentinel, phase 1 (schema 13, 2026-08-02). Four tables, written
# from sections 2.1 to 2.4 of
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-02-memory-sentinel-phase1-design.md and from
# nothing else. Applied to a NEW store by _ensure_schema and to an EXISTING
# schema-12 store by _migrate_12_to_13, which runs this exact same text: one
# definition, so a migrated store and a fresh store cannot drift.
#
# `trigger` is a column name here even though it is also a SQLite keyword.
# Checked against sqlite3 before it was written rather than assumed: SQLite
# accepts it unquoted as a column identifier in a CREATE TABLE, an INSERT, a
# WHERE clause and an index, which is the whole surface this project uses it
# on. The spec names the column `trigger`; renaming it to dodge a keyword
# that turns out not to collide would have put the code and the design out
# of step for no gain.

# Schema 14 (U1, the autonomy contract layer). Six tables, in the store's own
# DDL style. project_id carries a REFERENCES clause on all six, unlike
# attribution (which deliberately has none: an audit trail must outlive the
# project it describes). A contract about a project that does not exist is
# meaningless, and verify()'s dangling-reference check already reports
# exactly the damage a missing FK here would cause.
#
# THE IMMUTABILITY MODEL. autonomy_contracts is INSERT-ONLY: no UPDATE or
# DELETE statement anywhere in the service layer touches it (purge_project is
# the one deletion, and it removes the whole row, never edits one). A
# project's contract is a CHAIN of revisions: revision 1 is the signature,
# and every later state change (pause, resume, stop, revoke, amend) appends a
# full new row carrying the complete authorisation as it stands after that
# change. The LIVE contract is, by definition, the row with the highest
# revision for that project. Two live contracts is not prevented by a
# constraint, it is UNREPRESENTABLE: there is exactly one highest revision
# per project, and UNIQUE(project_id, revision) plus BEGIN IMMEDIATE
# (Store._transaction) makes a concurrent second signer collide and refuse
# rather than interleave.
#
# token_ceiling and minutes_ceiling are nullable INTEGER, and NULL is the
# only representation of "no ceiling was set"; zero is a real ceiling
# meaning "stop immediately", and conflating the two is what invariant I8
# exists to prevent.

# schema where a row is UPDATEd after insert, modelled column for column on
# alerts.resolved_at plus resolve_alert. The founder's immutability
# requirement is stated over CONTRACT rows; a queued human step is a to-do
# item, not an authorisation.

#
# insights.supersedes is a plain TEXT column with a store-level existence
# check, deliberately NOT a self-referencing foreign key. Two reasons,

# convention _autonomy_enum and every OwnershipRefusal above follow), and
# a self-FK would make purge_project's single "delete this project's
# whole chain" statement trip a per-row check for no gain.
#
# supersedes exists at all because the alternative breaks append-only: a
# forward "control_taken" pointer on the decision row would need an
# UPDATE the day a handback is taken. Instead the HANDBACK row carries
# supersedes at INSERT time, and "was the handback taken on decision X"
# becomes a query rather than a mutation.
#
# mutation and observed are their own columns, not free text inside
# evidence, because the rule that a CALIBRATION must name the control it
# broke and the count it observed is unenforceable buried in prose and is
# a refusal (R5) as a column. confidence_basis is split out of confidence
# for the same reason: "state the basis" is only checkable when it has
# somewhere of its own to live.
#
# briefings.run_state and briefings.open_steps are STORED so the
# phase-boundary trigger is a comparison against the previous ROW rather
# than against remembered state. There is no rendered-text column beyond

    existing task keeps every field it had and arrives with an empty
    phase, drawn as unphased rather than as belonging to anything.

    GUARDED ON PRAGMA table_info rather than assumed absent, for the same
    reason _migrate_7_to_8 states: this step also runs from
    _ensure_schema for a brand new store, where the column is already in
    the CREATE TABLE text, and ADD COLUMN on an existing name is a hard
    sqlite3 error that would refuse to open a fresh store.

    Same contract as every migration before it: it runs inside the
    caller's BEGIN EXCLUSIVE, so it must never commit, roll back, or open
    a transaction of its own.

    What it deliberately does NOT do: it does not backfill a phase for a
    single existing task. There is nothing to backfill FROM. The only
    available source would be the project's current phase, which says
    where the project is now, not where a task written three weeks ago
    belonged, and stamping every historical task with today's phase would
    make the very first Gantt this feature draws a fiction. Empty says
    "nobody recorded one", which is exactly true."""

# GATE C (fix-round 6, 2026-07-26): DEFAULT-DENY. dump() used to redact an
# enumerated list of "known sensitive" fields (objective, tier, claim paths,
# decisions, digests) and print everything else in cleartext, which is
# exactly why transitions.note, directives.text, records.evidence,
# records.check_cmd, and records.owner leaked: nobody had listed them. This
# is the inverse: every (table, column) pair below is the CLOSED,
# deliberately reviewed set of structurally non-sensitive data (identifiers,
# enums, versions, counts, hashes, timestamps); every OTHER text-typed
# column, read live from the schema via PRAGMA table_info (see
# _text_columns), is redacted automatically. A new text column added to
# _DDL without being added here is redacted by default, not exposed by
# default: the failure direction that matters is flipped.
# records.name was in this set until fix-round 7 (2026-07-26): it was
# treated as an identifier-shaped column like lifecycle_uuid, but a NAME is
# founder-typed free text (valid_name only rejects reserved characters and
# whitespace; it happily accepts "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE" or "password=hunter2"
# as a name), so listing it here meant the one dump column an adversary
# could put a real secret shape into was also the one this allowlist
# exempted from redaction. Removing it means dump()'s existing default-deny
# machinery (below) now redacts it exactly like every other free-text
# column, with no new call site: the record is still identifiable via its
# lifecycle_uuid, which is never redacted and sits right beside the name at
# every other exit (render_state_md, render_digest).

# NOT-FINALIZED item 15, found by the Loop 0 baseline: redact_text is a secret
# SCRUBBER. It removes secret-shaped substrings and lets ordinary prose through
# untouched, which was harmless while every text column held a work objective
# the founder had typed about their own project. These two columns are
# different in kind: they hold the founder's VERBATIM WORDS, captured from a
# correction, including whatever a frustrated founder happened to say about a
# client, a number, or a person. A dump is exactly what gets piped into a file
# or pasted into an issue.
#
# So these are replaced by a length marker rather than scrubbed. The marker
# keeps a dump structurally honest (you can see evidence exists and how much of
# it) without reproducing any of it. --raw still returns everything, and
# SECURITY.md already documents the database file itself as sensitive.
# LOOP 11 GENERALISED THIS. Those three columns were withheld because they
# hold verbatim founder words; the reasoning above is not special to them.
# records.objective, records.evidence, digests.body, transitions.note,
# decisions.text and directives.text are founder prose too, and the scrubber
# was never able to catch prose: "never mention the Q3 miss to Acme" carries
# no secret SHAPE at all, so an ordinary dump reproduced it verbatim.
# _DUMP_WITHHELD_COLUMNS is therefore no longer a list to maintain: WITHHELD
# IS NOW THE DEFAULT for every text column that is not structurally safe
# (_DUMP_SAFE_COLUMNS) and not explicitly scrub-only
# (_DUMP_SCRUB_ONLY_COLUMNS). The name is kept because tests and comments

# nothing, so every *_hash and *_fingerprint column sailed through the
# default-deny pass verbatim. Not cosmetic: founder_response_hash is an unsalted
# sha256 of the founder's literal answer, and real answers are short ("oui",
# "yes", "yes, always"), so a ten-word wordlist turns the digest back into the
# words mint_approval_receipt promises the store never keeps. Identical answers
# also show as identical digests, which is exactly the correlation the design
# says it does not hold. Digests are therefore WITHHELD by name-shape, read from
# the live schema like everything else here, so the next digest column anyone
# adds is covered the day it exists rather than the day someone remembers to
# list it. A digest carries no diagnostic value in a dump anyway: you cannot

#
# FIX-ROUND 11 (reported, reproduced, fixed here): the body class used to be
# the ASCII allowlist [A-Za-z0-9_.~\-/\\]. A match STOPS at the first
# character outside the class, and the (?<![A-Za-z0-9_]) lookbehind then
# blocks re-matching at the next separator, so the mask removed the

#   /Users/mueller/Kunden/Siemens (real u-umlaut) -> "[PATH WITHHELD]ller/..."
#   /Users/<CJK name>/<CJK client>/ACME           -> both names visible
#   /Users/j/C++Projects/acme-secret  -> "[PATH WITHHELD]++Projects/acme-secret"
#   also @ % # & = and every other punctuation mark outside the allowlist.
# Every non-ASCII path component (CJK, Cyrillic, Greek, accented Latin, which
# is most of the world's home directories) leaked in full, and the stated
# LIMIT below claimed the only gap was a SPACE. The class is therefore now a
# DENYLIST: a path component is anything that is not whitespace, not a
# control character, and not one of the few characters that really do end a
# path in prose. Two flat classes in sequence, no alternation, no nesting, so
# matching stays linear (400k characters still mask in single-digit ms).
#
# LIMITS, stated rather than hidden, and this is now the WHOLE list:
#  - a path containing a SPACE is masked only up to that space
#    ("/Users/j/Dev Work/x" leaves "Work/x" visible). Deliberate: swallowing
#    spaces would eat the rest of any sentence that merely mentions a path,
#    which is worse in the text exports this also runs in.
#  - masking stops at " ' ` < > | , ; : ( ) [ ] { } for that same prose
#    reason. Some of those (" < > | :) are illegal in a Windows path
#    outright, the rest are legal but rare in a real one, and all of them
#    are common sentence punctuation; a path that does contain one is masked
#    only up to it.
#  - a trailing . ! or ? stays outside the marker, so "see /Users/j/x." keeps
#    its full stop.
#
# LOOP 5 adds three things on top of the above, none of which touch the
# limits just stated for the PLAIN unquoted/unescaped case (they still
# apply, and are still true):
#
#  1. QUOTED PATHS. A quote character immediately in front of a recognised
#     path prefix extends the match to the MATCHING closing quote, spaces
#     included, so `"/Users/j/Dev Work/plan.md"` masks whole instead of
#     stopping at the internal space. A quoted path is common in shell
#     commands and in copy-pasted output; the quote pair IS the boundary the
#     founder already gave the string, so it takes priority over the space
#     rule above (which exists for exactly the case where no such boundary
#     was given).
#  2. ESCAPED SPACES. `\ ` (backslash then a literal space) is one path
#     character now, not a terminator, so an unquoted shell-escaped path
#     (`/Users/j/Dev\ Work/plan.md`) also masks whole.
#  3. ADJACENT TO A WORD CHARACTER. The FIX-ROUND 11 lookbehind
#     (?<![A-Za-z0-9_]) is still required for a bare "/" and for a
#     single-letter drive ("C:\\...") -- dropping it there turns
#     "https://example.com" into a masked "drive path" starting at the "s"
#     before "://" (proven against the shipped regex before this change) and
#     turns "tools/bm_store.py" into a masked path starting at "/bm_store.py".
#     But a KNOWN, distinctive home-directory root -- /Users, /home, /root,
#     /Volumes, /private, /cygdrive -- glued directly onto a preceding word
#     with NO separator at all ("note/Users/jane/secret") used to skip the
#     mask entirely (KNOWN-LIMITS: "a path immediately preceded by an
#     alphanumeric or an underscore is not masked at all"), and that gap is
#     closed for these six names specifically: they are distinctive enough
#     that the lookbehind is dropped for them alone. DISCLOSED TRADE: a
#     relative project path that happens to share one of these six segment
#     names glued the same way (e.g. "src/home/dashboard.tsx") is a false
#     positive under this rule and gets masked too; privacy wins that tie.
#     A single-letter drive letter glued to a preceding word
#     ("seeC:\Users\jane\x") is NOT covered by this loosening (the URL
#     collision above forces the lookbehind to stay on that one form) and

    withheld digests inside dump() alone and reached them before the safe list;

    digest-shaped columns (learning_candidates.content_hash,
    learning_applications.task_fingerprint) as structural. Merging the two lanes
    with the safe check first would have re-exported those digests, which is the
    exact leak P3 closed, so the shape rule runs before the allowlist and covers
    every export rather than only dump. Git shas stay visible: they are named
    *_sha and *_head, not *_hash or *_fingerprint.

    whole rows and passes every column through the full policy. A CLI's --json
    prints ONE entity to the operator who just typed the command, so it

    to --raw and lose the whole policy. The DIGEST rule is the one part that must
    hold on that surface too, because a digest is unreadable and therefore
    useless as diagnostics, while an unsalted digest of a line of a file is a
    confirmation oracle for text every other surface redacts.

    FIX ROUND P2, 2026-07-30, reproduced against a real store before this

    "[WITHHELD: 64-char digest]" while `bm_learn notes --json` two commands away
    printed the exact sha256 of the anchored line, so a note anchored at

    """THE PATH FUNNEL: the ONE public way this project builds a path to a
    generated file inside a project root, and the only shape allowed to be
    opened or written. Public on purpose, so bm_threads.py and any other
    caller use this instead of growing their own os.path.join.

        safe_project_path(root, "STATE.md")
        safe_project_path(root, "threads", name + ".md")

    Returns the absolute, containment-checked path. Creates NOTHING.

    WHY (finding 2B, CONFIRMED by execution): every root-relative path in
    this module except the store itself was a bare os.path.join, and
    os.path.join followed by open() follows a symlink silently. With
    STATE.md symlinked at a file outside the project, write_state_view read
    the TARGET's bytes and wrote them to <root>/STATE.md.bak-<stamp>, an
    ordinary in-repo file no project's .gitignore knows about, so a routine
    `git add -A` committed the copied content. Fixing that one call site
    would have left call site N+1 open, which is exactly how the twelve
    hand-fixed database handles were followed by a thirteenth leak, so the
    containment lives here and a structural test fails the build when a new
    site joins a root without it.

    Reuses the two containment primitives above rather than growing a third
    piece of symlink logic beside them:
      * _refuse_if_symlink_escape on EVERY existing component, root's
        immediate child down through the leaf, so a symlinked PARENT
        DIRECTORY is caught too, not only a symlinked leaf;
      * _refuse_if_hardlinked on any component that is a regular FILE.
        Deliberately NOT on directories: a POSIX directory always reports
        st_nlink >= 2 ('.' plus its parent's entry; measured on this
        machine: 2 for an empty directory, 4 with two subdirectories), so
        applying the hardlink check to a directory would refuse every
        legitimate path on the platform.

    The path is built under the RESOLVED root, so a project living beneath
    a symlinked prefix (macOS /tmp -> /private/tmp) is normal rather than
    an escape, and the final result must still resolve to itself and sit
    inside that resolved root. Any violation raises
    OwnershipRefused('path-escape') naming the path and what it resolved

# render_state_md), so the sqlite file itself is the sensitive artefact
# SECURITY.md says it is. Everything protecting it from git was, until now,
# a best-effort WRITE: _ensure_git_excludes appends three lines to
# info/exclude and swallows OSError so the store still opens. Two holes
# follow directly from "write, never verify":
#   * an exclude rule does NOT untrack a file git already tracks. A repo
#     that already has .brothermode/store.sqlite3 in its index (added by
#     accident, or by someone else, or inherited by cloning a repo the
#     founder did not create) keeps committing the raw store on every
#     routine `git add -A`, with every exclude line present and correct.
#   * when the write fails, the store opens anyway and nothing is excluded.
#
# So the write stays (it is what makes the healthy case healthy) and is now
# followed by a CHECK of git's actual state, run on every writable open,
# before sqlite3.connect creates or touches the database. Two questions,
# both answered from git's own files:
#   1. is any of .brothermode/, the store, or its -wal/-shm sidecars in the
#      index? -> refuse 'git-tracked-store', naming the untracking command.
#   2. are those paths genuinely ignored? -> refuse 'git-exposed-store'.
# An answer that cannot be established (an index this parser does not
# understand, an unreadable .gitignore) refuses 'git-state-unknown' rather
# than assuming the safe answer, because assuming the safe answer is the
# defect being closed.
#

# Before this, _is_transient_busy_error was a two-string allowlist and
# everything outside it was ASSUMED to be corruption, with no evidence that
# the file was damaged at all. A transient disk I/O error, a permission
# problem or a network-volume hiccup during the SessionStart hook's
# automatic `verify` was therefore enough to move a perfectly healthy store
# aside. The default is now inverted: quarantine happens only for a NAMED
# condition, and anything unrecognized reports without touching the file.
#
# QUARANTINES (evidence that the file itself is damaged):
#   * a cause that is not a sqlite3.Error at all. This module raises those
#     itself, and only after reading the file: zero length on disk, a table
#     genuinely absent from sqlite_master, a schema_version that does not
#     match. Those are findings, not guesses.
#   * type(cause) is exactly sqlite3.DatabaseError. Measured (Python 3.9.6,
#     SQLite 3.51.0): SQLITE_NOTADB raises DatabaseError('file is not a
#     database') and SQLITE_CORRUPT raises DatabaseError('database disk
#     image is malformed'); both arrive as the BASE class, never as an
#     OperationalError. That is the corruption class, by construction.
#   * a message naming corruption or a not-a-database file (below), so a
#     future SQLite that routes one of these through a subclass is still
#     caught.
#   * "no such table" / "no such column" from an OperationalError. This is
#     structural schema damage, not an environment hiccup: every table
#     named here is created by this module's own DDL, so sqlite reporting
#     one missing is evidence the schema was damaged (CRITICAL A,
#     fix-round 8, reproduced: drop the claims table, claim again, GRANTED
#     at exit 0). Kept deliberately.

        THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR (P7 fix round, reproduced on the real CLI).
        The index is maintained only by connections that have the fast path
        on, and the switch is a per-PROCESS environment variable. One ordinary
        shell that approves or edits a rule without it leaves the index behind
        with no error anywhere, and _ensure_fts repopulated only when it had
        just CREATED the table, so that gap was permanent: the next FTS5 run
        found a table, trusted it, and answered from text the founder had
        already deleted, while the CLI explained the hit as a stem match that
        no live word could produce. That is a correctness failure, not a
        reporting one: bm25 dominates the ranking, so a stale row outranked a
        rule with three times its exact overlap, and --limit then dropped the
        right rule entirely.

        The fix is placed at the point of CONSUMPTION rather than at open,
        because open time cannot see a write another process makes a second
        later, and because verify and index-status keep their value only if
        they can still SEE drift and say so. Cost is two small queries per
        retrieval against a table holding one row per founder rule.

        Repair needs write authority. A store that cannot repair (locked by
        another writer, read-only) turns the fast path off and takes the
        lexical path, which is the mode that always works and is reported

        could route it to a migration. Quarantining a store whose only problem
        is that it predates an upgrade is data loss dressed as caution.

        Four outcomes, and only one of them quarantines:
          * version matches -> verify this version's tables, as before;

            migrate, and must never quarantine for this either);
          * version is NEWER than this binary -> refuse and say so. The store
            is fine; the binary is old. Touching it would be the damage.
          * version is missing, unparseable, or an unknown older one -> that is
            genuine corruption or an unsupported downgrade, and quarantines.

        migrate=False is the SAFE default so that any caller which forgets to

        Quarantine is for a DAMAGED store. A store that is merely newer than
        this binary, or merely older and awaiting migration, is undamaged, and
        moving it would be the only data loss in the situation. But a refusal
        still has to close the connection it opened: the leak detector in
        test_bm_store.py exists because an unclosed handle passes on POSIX and
        fails on Windows, which is how it reached CI run 18 undetected.

        `reason` says WHICH of those two things this is, and changes the
        exception (2026-08-04). Not moving the file was never enough: every
        caller that catches StoreCorrupt prints "STORE CORRUPT: ..." and exits
        1, so a founder whose store was one version behind was told their data
        was damaged when nothing was wrong with it at all. With a reason, this
        raises OwnershipRefused instead, which the CLI already prints as
        "refused (<reason>): ..." at exit 2, the code this project already uses
        everywhere for "this is about your situation, not your file". Without
        one, it stays StoreCorrupt: the pre-migration-backup failure below is a
        real write failure mid-migration, not a healthy store.

        The two reasons are written out one branch each, with the code as a
        LITERAL string, on purpose. A single OwnershipRefused(reason, message)
        here would pass a variable, which

        Three properties, each a named requirement rather than a preference,

        BACKED UP FIRST. A copy of the store is written through sqlite's own
        backup API before a single DDL statement runs. A filesystem copy is not
        equivalent: with WAL enabled, recent committed writes can still live in
        the -wal sidecar, so copying the main file alone can produce a backup
        missing the newest records. The backup API checkpoints for us.

        ONE EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION, AND THE VERSION MOVES LAST. Every table and
        index is created, and only then is meta.schema_version updated, all
        inside BEGIN EXCLUSIVE. An interruption anywhere rolls the whole thing
        back and leaves the store at its old version, structurally untouched
        and re-runnable. This ordering is what makes a half-migration
        impossible, which matters because _verify_schema_or_raise checks that
        expected tables are PRESENT and deliberately does not check that no
        others exist: a half-created table set with an already-bumped version
        would otherwise pass verification and look healthy.

        destroying the first's evidence) and left the sidecars (where the
        actually-lost records can live, WAL keeping recent writes there
        before a checkpoint) behind entirely. The directory name carries
        microsecond precision plus a uuid4 suffix via os.makedirs(exist_ok=
        False), so a name is never reused and nothing is ever replaced onto
        an existing path.

        GATE C: sidecars are COPIED into the quarantine directory BEFORE
        self.conn.close() runs, not after: a newer bundled SQLite (3.53.1,
        with a recent Python 3.13) DELETES stale -wal/-shm files as part of
        close()'s own cleanup, so the old close-then-move order sometimes
        found nothing left to move, worse than the original defect and
        silently version-dependent. Copying while the handle is still open
        is unaffected by whatever close() does to the originals; the main
        file is still moved only after close(), since close() can only act
        on the connection's own handle, not a sidecar file.

        `return Store._quarantine_and_raise(self, cause)`), so a read-only
        health check could move the real database; it now OVERRIDES this
        entry point and raises instead, which makes the containment
        structural rather than a boolean somebody has to remember to check.
        The classification guard below is the second half of the same fix:

        nothing, and touches the inbox file not at all.

        Architecture, per the founder's decision 3.1.3: the per-project store is
        the system of record and the vault's corrections.jsonl is a global
        capture inbox. Triage moves an inbox row into a project. Global scope is
        an explicit choice the founder makes at APPROVAL, never a default here,
        so an imported candidate lands project-scoped and stays that way until
        he says otherwise.

        IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION. Identity is a property of the row itself
        (session id plus normalized text, bm_learning.inbox_identity), not of
        when the import ran, so running the backfill twice imports nothing the
        second time and no bookkeeping file has to be trusted to make that true.

        A row is deliberately imported with an EMPTY proposed action. The
        founder writes the rule at approval; approval refuses an empty action as
        non-atomic. So the automatic path cannot produce something approvable
        without him typing the rule, which is invariant L1 held up by the shape
        of the data rather than by a promise.

        `rows` are already-parsed dicts, so this method reads no file and the
        single-writer property of this module is unchanged. A row that parsed as
        valid JSON but is NOT an object (a bare string, a number, a list) is
        counted as malformed and skipped: the inbox file is edited by hand and
        by other tools, and a founder-facing backfill may not die on a traceback

        return a one-time token that lets `approve` act on that answer.

        This is the founder-side half of Model A (post-audit LOOP 3, founder
        decision 2026-07-29). It exists because the previous design was honest
        about intent and dishonest about mechanism: `approve` took a free-text
        founder_ref, the CLI GENERATED a default one saying "run by the
        founder", and any process that could invoke the CLI, or import this
        module, could therefore manufacture an approved rule with nobody
        answering anything. Reproduced on 2026-07-29 against a throwaway store:
        an imported call to bm_learn.main(["approve", id]) created rule 90dc290e
        at exit 0 with no human in the loop.

        WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE. It proves that this token was minted,
        against this candidate, against this exact rule text, and has not been
        spent. It does NOT prove which human typed the answer: nothing here
        authenticates an identity, and no wording in this project may claim it
        does. What changes is that a background process can no longer approve by
        accident or by default, because there is no default: the token is 48
        hex characters of os.urandom that never touches the store, so it cannot
        be derived from anything a hook can read.

        founder_response is the founder's literal answer. It is HASHED, never
        stored: the store keeps no copy of the words, which keeps the most
        sensitive text in this flow out of the file, out of dump, and out of
        every display surface.

        text, within the last fifteen minutes, and only once.

        AN OVERRIDE IS NOT A DISARM, and this is the fix round's central
        correction. This method used to skip any note whose overridden_at was
        set, and the override is written on the NOTE ROW, so one founder
        override recorded at one gate made a still-unresolved critical alert
        invisible to every later gate: the next approval saw no alert, printed no
        stakes line about it, asked the founder nothing, and closed clean, while
        `notes --open --severity critical` still listed the alert as unanswered.
        A blocking alert now keeps blocking until it is RESOLVED (someone
        answered it) or until the founder overrides it AT THIS GATE, where the
        override is bound to a receipt minted against a fingerprint that
        includes it. The row's own overridden_at stays exactly what it was, a
        record of the first override, and is reported beside the refusal so a
        founder can see the alert was forced past before.

        Matching is by EQUALITY on the identifier anchors, which is safe because
        add_note resolves a typed prefix to a full uuid at the door. It used to
        be a startswith against the raw anchor, so a one-character anchor
        blanketed every candidate in the store.

        Returns a list of note rows, oldest first, each carrying an extra

        """Rules relevant to a task, most relevant first, each able to say why.

        Read-only by contract: it writes nothing, records no application, and
        does not store the query. Recording an application is a separate,
        explicit call, so merely ASKING what applies can never pollute the
        outcome data (invariant L10 depends on that separation).

        Eligibility is a hard filter before ranking: only injectable states,
        and only rules whose scope the supplied context actually matches.

        `limit` caps SOFT rules only. Every applicable live gate rule is
        returned no matter what the caller passed, including limit 0 and
        negative limits, and the result reports gates_returned, gates_total,
        soft_returned and soft_omitted so the two can be told apart.

        LOOP 3 adds the other half: every gate is ALWAYS returned, but not
        every gate is returned as FULL TEXT. `gate_manifest` in the result is
        the compact, bounded-per-gate listing of every applicable gate,
        independent of query or ranking (see bm_learning.gate_manifest).
        Each row also carries `presentation` ('expanded' or 'manifest') and,
        for gates, `expansion_reason`: full text is included in `results`
        only for a gate that clears one of the four Layer B triggers
        (bm_learning.gate_expansion_reason), and even then bm_learning's
        GATE_EXPANSION_CAP bounds how many gates this single call may expand,
        so full-text size cannot grow without limit alongside the corpus.
        `expand_ids` lets a caller pull a specific gate's full text by its
        short id or rule_uuid regardless of relevance. A gate that does not
        make the expansion cut is never dropped from `results`: it is
        included with presentation='manifest', matching the manifest, so
        gates_returned/gates_total keeps meaning exactly what it always has
        (every applicable gate accounted for), and only the TEXT shown for
        it is deferred to the manifest line."""

    # 1. Asking stays free. retrieve_learning_rules above is read only and

    #    returns the rules whatever happens to the write, and reports the write
    #    failure in a field rather than raising over the top of the answer the
    #    caller actually needed. A learning system that can make retrieval fail
    #    is worse than one that forgets.
    # 3. History is immutable. An application points at a rule VERSION, and
    #    every read joins that version's text, so editing a rule tomorrow can
    #    never rewrite what a model was shown yesterday (invariant L8).

        share task wording collapsed onto one row: the second one recorded

        work are two applications of the rule, whatever they were called.

          1. a row already pointing at THIS record: the same work, seen again.
          2. otherwise an UNCLAIMED row (record_uuid still null): the normal

        LOOP 4 adds durable work identity. `require_record_identity=True`
        (bm_learn.py's `apply` always passes it; `lookup` never calls this
        method at all) refuses BEFORE any retrieval runs, with no partial
        write and no rules returned, unless the caller supplied exactly one
        of: `record_prefix` (an existing work record), `new_record_name` (a
        provisional one, created atomically with this call, see
        _insert_provisional_record), or ACTIVE_RECORD_ENV in the
        environment. This is deliberately NOT folded into the record_error /
        record_error_kind soft-failure path below: a missing identity is not
        a database write that failed, it is the caller never having
        supplied the one thing this whole loop exists to require, so it is
        refused as loudly as a missing --session already is at the CLI
        layer, and enforced here too so a direct API caller gets the same
        refusal a CLI caller does.

        LOOP 3: each application row also records `presentation` ('expanded'
        or 'manifest', from the retrieval's per-row decision) and
        `action_reached` ('yes' when this row's expansion reason was
        specifically that the query's wording reached the gate's own
        action_text, 'no' for every other row, including a soft rule or a
        manifest-only gate). Both are additive columns (schema 10); a row
        written before schema 10 reads back 'unknown' for each, which is the
        honest answer for a run this loop never observed, not a backfilled
        guess.

        One application row per returned rule VERSION per unit of work.
        Idempotent per (task fingerprint, rule, version, session, work record):
        running the same retrieval twice for the same work records once and
        reports the rest as already present, because a model that re-reads its
        rules mid-task has not applied them twice.

        THE WORK RECORD IS PART OF THAT KEY, and see _prior_application for
        why: without it, two different pieces of substantial work in one
        session that shared task wording collapsed onto a single row, and the
        second one recorded nothing while still reporting success.

        Idempotent does NOT mean the second call is discarded. The natural
        order of work is retrieve first, claim the work record second, then
        re-run with --record once there is something to link to. A row whose
        record_uuid is still missing therefore has it ATTACHED here and comes
        back counted as `linked`. Nothing else in this codebase can set that
        column afterwards, so dropping the flag would strand the row for good
        and permanently unlink the application from the work it belongs to.
        An application already pointing at a DIFFERENT record is never touched
        and never moved: that work keeps its row, and this work gets its own
        (this is the structural "never relink" guarantee LOOP 4's link
        protection names: _prior_application's own lookup never selects a
        foreign-linked row for UPDATE, so there is no code path here that
        could move a link even by accident).

        The retrieval result is returned whatever happens to the write, and
        that now includes a bad --record. Resolving the work record prefix is
        part of the WRITE, not a precondition of the read, so a mistyped id
        comes back as `record_error` with the rules intact instead of aborting
        the whole run and leaving the caller with no founder rules at all.
        `record_error_kind` says which sort of failure it was, because a bad
        argument will fail identically forever and a busy database will not.
        LOOP 4 adds two more named `record_error_kind` values from the SAME
        resolution step, both refusals rather than database failures:
        'closed-record' (the record's state is 'complete') and
        'provisional-cross-session' (an unpromoted provisional record
        created by a different session)."""

        Ignoring a gate or a substantial rule REQUIRES a reason. That refusal
        is the whole point of the field: a gate quietly skipped and never
        explained is the failure this mechanism exists to make visible, and a
        blank reason would let it pass as bookkeeping.

        The disposition also lands as evidence on the rule, so a rule that
        keeps being followed earns its way towards 'confirmed' and a rule that
        keeps being ignored carries the contradicting evidence to show for it.

        ONE evidence row per application, replaced in place, never
        accumulated. Evidence counts APPLICATIONS, not keystrokes. The earlier
        shape wrote a row whenever the disposition CHANGED, which stopped
        verbatim repeats and nothing else: alternating followed and ignored on
        a single application (the realistic "I closed that one wrong, fix it")
        manufactured unbounded support and contradict rows for a rule with
        exactly one application. That ledger is what the founder reads in
        `why` and what admits a rule to 'confirmed', so it may not be forgeable

        Two kinds of finding come out of here. Per application, the pure
        classifier in bm_learning decides from the row alone. Per TASK, this
        method can see something no single row can: a rule that was
        retrievable for that task, already approved when the task ran, and has
        no application row at all. That is a retrieval miss.

        THE DENOMINATOR COMES FROM THE STORED RUN, NOT FROM A GUESS (LOOP P6).
        The scope context, the requested limit and the eligible count are read
        off the learning_retrieval_runs row written when the retrieval actually
        happened. Before that row existed, the context was rebuilt from the
        scope_match values of the rows that DID land, which is circular: a task
        where no project rule was returned reported an empty project context,
        so every project rule it missed was invisible and the miss count read
        zero. Reproduced on the real CLI (limit 0, one global gate and one
        project rule in scope: the project rule was cut and classify reported
        no misses).

        MISSES ARE SPLIT BY CAUSE, because the fixes differ:
          - retrieval_miss: the rule ranked INSIDE the limit the caller asked
            for and still has no application row. Ranking or scope is wrong.
          - retrieval_limit_miss: the rule ranked outside that limit. The
            ranking was right and the limit was too small.
        A gate is never a limit miss: gates are exempt from the limit by
        construction, so a missing gate is always the harder finding.

        FIVE THINGS IT REFUSES TO DECIDE, each reported rather than guessed:
          - a task whose application rows predate the run table (legacy);
          - a task that kept no terms, so nothing can be re-ranked;
          - a task whose rule corpus no longer matches the eligible count the
            run recorded, so today's ranking is not that retrieval's ranking
            (see _historical_corpus);
          - a rule whose current version was written AFTER the retrieval, so
            today's text is not the text that would have been ranked;
          - a rule the founder approved after the task ran, which is not a
            miss at all and is skipped silently.

        `not_decidable_tasks` entries carry `evidence` naming which of these it
        was. Every miss carries `miss_kind`, and both kinds stay in
        `retrieval_misses` so the denominator is not split across two lists;
        `counts` reports them under their two separate class names."""

        Returns (rules, drift_reason). A non-empty reason means the caller must
        report not_decidable and grade nothing.

        WHY THIS EXISTS (FIX ROUND P6). The miss split was decided by re-ranking
        TODAY's corpus while claiming the stored run as its authority.
        Deprecating one unrelated rule after the fact moved the missed rule's
        position and flipped its class from retrieval_limit_miss to
        retrieval_miss, which is the difference between "your page size was too
        small" and "your ranking or scope is wrong": opposite fixes, on facts
        that did not change. Reproduced on the real CLI before this was written.

        TWO STEPS, AND THE ORDER MATTERS.
          1. Rules the founder approved AFTER the retrieval are dropped. They
             could not have been in that corpus, and leaving them in inflated
             the soft positions of the rules that were.
          2. What remains is COUNTED against the eligible_count the run itself
             recorded. Equal means today's eligible set can stand in for the
             one that ran. Different means rules have been deprecated,
             forgotten or reworded out of eligibility since, the historical
             corpus is not reconstructable, and the loop's own instruction
             applies: say not_decidable rather than use the current corpus as
             if it were historical.

        The count is the strongest check available from what is stored: the run

        """Move a record along its legal state graph. Every failure to match
        lifecycle_uuid, expected_version, AND a legal source state for
        to_state raises StaleIdentity naming the actual current state and
        version, so a caller reacts to an illegal move and a stale version
        the same way: re-read the record and decide what is actually true.

        OWNERSHIP GUARDS ONLY ACTIVE RECORDS (BLOCKER 2 fix, release-blockers
        spec, 2026-07-26; this was my own specification error, per that
        spec). A non-empty owning session_id blocks a move ONLY when the
        record's CURRENT state (row["state"], before this transition) is
        'active': that is the one state with a live writer to protect. A
        parked record has no live writer by definition, so ANY session may
        resume it and becomes its owner in the same transition; that is the
        whole point of the founder's reversibility requirement (`off` today,
        `resume` tomorrow from a different session, must work). The OLD
        check compared session_id unconditionally for every to_state except
        'adopted', which wrongly refused that legitimate resume-tomorrow
        case: a parked record's session_id column still holds its last
        owner (park does not clear it), so resuming looked identical to
        stealing someone else's still-live work. Since 'parked'/'complete'
        can only be reached FROM 'active' (see _LEGAL_MOVES), the
        state=='active' condition is a no-op for those two moves (the guard
        keeps working exactly as before); it only changes 'active' itself
        (resume), which can never be reached FROM 'active' at all, so the
        guard no longer applies there.

        'adopted' (SOFT 10) remains the one exception among moves FROM an
        ACTIVE record: adopting a dead session's ACTIVE record is the
        legitimate cross-session path, and even that was originally too
        wide (SOFT E): adopting a record CURRENTLY ACTIVE under a
        different, live session is a takeover dressed as adoption, so it
        now requires adopt_from_live_session=True (CLI:
        --adopt-from-live-session) explicitly, and the displacement is
        named in the refusal and the transition's note. Adopting a PARKED
        record needs neither exception: a parked record already has no
        live writer to displace.

        GATE 6: resuming (or parking/completing) into a name another
        lifecycle now holds active violates the one-active-per-name unique
        index; caught here and turned into the same 'name-active' refusal
        claim() uses, rather than an unhandled sqlite3.IntegrityError.

        LOOP P12: handover_heading, when given, writes the record's handover
        into the handovers table INSIDE this same transaction (see
        _insert_handover). That is the loop's whole invariant, and it is the
        reason it is a parameter here rather than a second call the caller
        makes afterwards: a refused transition can no longer leave a delivered
        handover behind (the old GATE 3 defect, in a stronger form), and a
        handover that cannot be built (redaction unavailable) rolls the
        transition back instead of parking a thread whose context is gone.
        Leave it None and nothing about this method changes."""

        transaction (transition()'s), which is the whole invariant: the
        lifecycle transition and the handover it produced commit together or
        neither of them exists.

        Its own named method rather than five inline statements so a
        reinjection test can monkeypatch exactly this symbol (to raise, or to
        write nothing) and prove the calibration of the atomicity tests.

        RedactionUnavailable from render_digest propagates: it aborts the whole
        transaction, so a store that cannot redact parks nothing and writes
        nothing, rather than recording a transition whose handover was lost.

        A duplicate loses on handovers_undelivered_text_idx and is swallowed
        HERE, not by the caller: that is the retry path. But the swallow is
        conditional now (fix round, 2026-07-29). It is only honest while an
        UNDELIVERED row carrying this exact lifecycle, fingerprint AND heading
        is still there to render, which is what makes "the earlier row already
        holds this exact text" true. So the swallow re-reads for that twin and
        raises HandoverLost when it cannot find one, which aborts the caller's
        transaction: no handover, no transition.

        The old code returned "already" for ANY IntegrityError and transition()
        discarded the value, so a park whose insert lost committed a lifecycle
        move with nothing to hand over. The index change (partial on
        delivered_at IS NULL, heading in the key) is what removes the loss; this

        the separate `cross_project_edges_removed` key, naming the
        affected foreign task ids, so a caller never folds another
        project's own fallout into this project's totals. A7: an alert is

        also claimed by another project's own trail is ambiguous ownership

    # Twelve methods over the four sentinel tables. `actor` is the same
    # small dict every LOOP 1 method above takes, and it is here for the
    # same job: each method that CHANGES state and takes an actor writes
    # its row and its attribution row in ONE self._transaction(), both or
    # neither. That is not a choice made here, it is this module's standing
    # rule (every one of the twelve actor-taking methods above does it) and
    # the design points at upsert_project by name for exactly this.
    # mark_surfaced and judge_intervention take no actor and write no
    # attribution: mark_surfaced only bumps a counter on rows whose
    # creation is already attributed and whose surfacing the ledger row
    # itself names, and judge_intervention records its own grader in
    # judged_by, on the row it grades.
    #
    # Free text is stored EXACTLY as given, never scrubbed on the way in.
    # Same as every LOOP 1 method above, and deliberately unlike add_note,
    # for two reasons the design forces: the reminder the sentinel prints
    # has to be the verbatim sentence somebody recorded, or the ledger
    # grades text nobody wrote; and the export side already withholds all
    # of it, because dump() is default-deny read from the LIVE schema, so
    # these four tables' prose columns are withheld the day they exist
    # without one entry being added to any allowlist.
    #
    # The reads below return PLAIN row dicts (like list_notes), not
    # _export_row dicts: they feed the selector and the reminder renderer
    # inside this process, and a selector handed WITHHELD placeholders
    # would be matching tokens against the redactor's own output. dump()
    # remains the export surface and still withholds every one of these
    # columns.

        `bm-controller plan --project p1 --run <p2's run id>` checked its

        took the id as an INDEPENDENT argument and had nothing to compare
        it against, so nothing in the store could refuse. The store cannot
        infer which project a caller means; it can insist the caller say,

        Rhymes with the fence store's cmd_adopt on purpose: adoption is
        EXPLICIT (never a side effect of step or stop), it DISPLACES the
        previous driver by name, and the handover is recorded durably in

        there is no adopt_from_live_session split here: EVERY adoption of
        another session's run is treated as the deliberate displacement

        anything is iterated, else 'bad-scope-container' naming the field

        canonical_write_scope_entry, which is the literal-path rule

        again of the RESOLVED string, because '.' and '..' segments
        collapse and can re-spell a refused entry as an accepted one.

        `project_id`, when given, is the project the caller BELIEVES this
        run belongs to, and a disagreement refuses 'run-not-in-project'
        before anything is written (AZ F2: a plan aimed at p1 and carrying
        p2's run id replaced p2's unit graph, cancelled its dispatches,
        parked its fences and un-paused it). See _refuse_foreign_run.

        UPSERT semantics (design section 5 fault 8, "resume does not
        repeat completed work across a version change"): a unit_id already
        persisted for this run whose newly computed definition_hash
        EQUALS the stored one is left completely untouched, status
        included, whatever it is (including DONE): it is REUSED, never
        re-run. A unit_id already persisted whose hash DIFFERS is
        redefined in place (its status is recomputed by dependency
        satisfaction and its retry_count resets to 0: a changed definition
        is a new attempt, not a continuation of the old one's retry
        count). A unit_id from a PRIOR call that is absent from THIS call
        is marked SKIPPED, unless it is already DONE, which is left alone
        (upstream redesign should never silently discard completed,
        still-valid work), and its open dispatches are CANCELLED with it.
        A SKIPPED unit that a later call RE-ADDS byte-identically is
        REVIVED (status only), because the founder re-adding it is the
        founder undoing the drop. A unit_id never seen before is inserted
        PENDING or READY by dependency satisfaction against the run's
        CURRENT persisted state, unless another PROJECT already holds that
        id, which refuses 'unit-id-taken' rather than raising sqlite's own
        IntegrityError.

        CASCADE (design section 5 fault 3, "a final edit invalidates
        prior evidence"): after every unit above is written, a second
        fixed-point pass walks the WHOLE run and resets any DONE unit
        whose dependency chain now includes a non-DONE unit (directly
        redefined above, or transitively downstream of one that was):
        status recomputed by dependency satisfaction, checkpoint_ref and
        fence_uuid cleared, retry_count reset to 0. A downstream unit's
        prior green checkpoint proved something about an upstream
        artifact that no longer exists once the upstream unit's own
        definition changes; carrying that checkpoint forward would let a
        stale H1-based verification stand in for the H2 that actually

        open_run's own docstring for the same split). `project_id`, when
        given, refuses 'run-not-in-project' for a unit of another
        project's run before any write (see _refuse_foreign_run).

        REFUSES 'unit-not-claimable' when the unit's status is not one
        select_ready_units would hand out (cross-family refuter, finding
        5). The update used to be unconditional, by unit id alone, so a
        claim built on a selection taken BEFORE a concurrent re-plan
        overwrote whatever the re-plan had decided: process A selects u1
        while the run is READY, process B plans without u1 and commits it
        SKIPPED, A resumes with its stale list and turns SKIPPED into
        CLAIMED, and work the founder explicitly removed is dispatched.
        The same hole let a CLAIMED unit be re-claimed under a second
        fence, silently orphaning the first.

        THE PREDICATE IS THE SET select_ready_units SELECTS, NOT LITERALLY
        'READY'. That method returns units that are PENDING or READY ("a
        PENDING unit whose dependencies are now all DONE is reported ready
        here; the engine flips it to READY on claim via claim_unit"), so a
        literal status='READY' predicate would refuse every dependent unit
        in the product: measured, a two-unit graph leaves u2 PENDING right
        through u1 completing, and the claim is what moves it. It refuses
        rather than no-opping, because a silent no-op leaves the caller
        believing it holds a unit it does not, which is how the dispatch
        got written in the first place.

        Both halves of the guard are kept deliberately. _transaction opens
        BEGIN IMMEDIATE, which serialises the read against another process,
        and the UPDATE carries the predicate anyway with its rowcount
        checked, so the WRITE ITSELF cannot land on a status that moved."""

            V1  not-found          the project row does not exist
            V2  bad-view-kind      kind is not in VIEW_KINDS
            V3  path-escape        rel_path does not resolve inside the
                                   project root (raised by
                                   safe_project_path, this store's one
                                   path funnel, not re-implemented here)
            V4  bad-fingerprint    not exactly 12 lowercase hex characters
            V5  bad-artifact-url   non empty and not an https URL
            V6  unknown-field      a key outside VIEW_FIELDS

        V1's code is 'not-found', which is this store's own universal code
        for "the row you named does not exist" (record_insight's R15 uses
        it for the identical condition). The design names that refusal
        'unknown-project'; a second code meaning exactly what 'not-found'
        already means would fork a convention 27 call sites follow, so the
        landed code keeps the store's word and this docstring records the
        difference rather than hiding it.

        V5 exists because an artifact_url is a capability: anyone holding
        it can open the page. Refusing anything but https keeps a
        javascript: or file: URL out of a column a renderer will later put
        in an href.

        V6 is an OwnershipRefused where the ledger's own R16 is a
        ValueError, and the difference is deliberate rather than sloppy: a
        page renderer must rewrite every refusal into a founder-facing
        block keyed by REASON CODE (law L-S9), and a bare ValueError
        carries no code, so it would reach the founder as raw Python. The
        not-a-dict case below stays a ValueError, because that one is a
        caller passing the wrong type and can never be shown to a
        founder."""

    WHAT WAS WRONG (cross-family refuter, finding 4). This opened an
    ordinary read-WRITE sqlite3.connect(path) and only afterwards executed
    PRAGMA query_only=ON. query_only stops SQL statements from writing; it
    does not stop the OPEN itself from writing, and for a WAL database the
    open is a write: measured on this machine, a plain connect to a
    cleanly-closed WAL store whose sidecars had been removed CREATED both
    store.sqlite3-wal and store.sqlite3-shm and left them behind, so a
    purely diagnostic `bm-controller status` mutated the store directory.
    Where the directory forbids that, it was worse than a mutation: the
    open raised 'attempt to write a readonly database', which is not a
    transient-busy error, so ReadOnlyStore.__init__ quarantine-classified
    it and reported a PERFECTLY HEALTHY store as StoreCorrupt.

    THE LADDER, and why it is a ladder rather than one spelling. sqlite has
    two read-only modes and neither covers both cases alone:

      mode=ro           opens the database file O_RDONLY, reads THROUGH the
                        WAL with real locks, and is therefore the honest
                        answer whenever a WAL exists. It still needs the
                        -shm (sqlite's shared-memory bookkeeping, not the
                        database), and it cannot CREATE the -wal, so
                        against a store with no -wal at all it fails with
                        'unable to open database file'.

      mode=ro&immutable=1
                        creates nothing whatsoever and works in a
                        directory with no write permission, because it
                        tells sqlite the file is not changing and so no
                        WAL, no -shm and no locking are needed.

    So: with a -wal present, mode=ro, always, and never immutable, because
    immutable IGNORES the WAL and a diagnostic that silently reports the
    pre-WAL state of a live store is the same class of lie fix-round 4
    exists to prevent (test_a_pending_wal_is_read_through_and_not_ignored
    pins that). With NO -wal there is nothing pending by definition, and
    immutable is both the accurate description of the file and the only
    open that touches nothing.

    THE RACE THIS LEAVES, stated rather than buried. A writer can create a
    -wal between the stat and the open, which would leave an immutable
    connection reading a file that is being checkpointed underneath it. The
    -wal is re-checked immediately after the open and the connection is
    thrown away and retaken WAL-aware if one appeared, so the residual
    window is a writer that opens, commits, checkpoints AND closes inside
    it. That is not closed, and cannot be from this side without taking the
    write lock a read-only diagnostic must not take.

    PRAGMA query_only=ON is kept, as a second defence that does not share a
    failure mode with the first: mode=ro is enforced by the OS on the file
    handle, query_only by sqlite on the statement.

    The whole ladder lives in THIS function, including both PRAGMA calls,
    rather than in an opening helper beside it. That is deliberate: GATE 4
    (test_structural_gate4_bare_execute_sites_are_all_named_exceptions)
    holds every bare .execute() site to a closed, named set, and
    _connect_read_only is already in it as "the one place a read-only
    connection is opened, before self.conn exists". Splitting the open out
    would have meant widening that set, and one exempt site is a smaller
    surface than two."""

    GENERATED markers, preserving any human prose outside them. A file with

    file that does not exist yet gets just the generated block.

    GATE A (VERIFIED BY ORCHESTRATOR: hand-edit a rendered STATE.md the way
    a human would, deleting the END line and adding their own notes, then
    render twice): the old naive containment test ("BEGIN in existing and
    END in existing") let render 1 append a fresh block after the damaged
    file, then let render 2's splice use the FIRST BEGIN and the ONLY END,
    deleting everything between them, notes included, at exit 0 with no
    warning. The marker-injection guard only ever neutralized markers
    arriving FROM THE STORE (GATE 8b); it trusted markers already IN THE
    FILE. Fixed by failing closed: the existing file's marker COUNT must be
    exactly (0, 0) or (1, 1), or this refuses ('view-markers-damaged')
    rather than guess which BEGIN belongs to which END. Whenever the file
    already has content and passes that check, it is saved first as
    STATE.md.bak-<UTC stamp> (reported on stderr): a generated file may
    overwrite its own block, but may never irrecoverably lose what a human
    wrote.

    GATE B: the final write routes through _write_generated_file (THE FILE
    FUNNEL), never _atomic_write_text directly, so a missing redactor
    refuses the ENTIRE write instead of silently writing raw founder text
    (the record NAME) at exit 0 with no warning. See docs/superpowers/specs/
    2026-07-26-phase1-fix-round-7.md for the full incident writeups.

    FINDING 2B: both the read below and the backup write route through
    safe_project_path (THE PATH FUNNEL), computed BEFORE any work is done,
    so a symlinked STATE.md refuses 'path-escape' instead of having its
    target's bytes read and copied into an in-repo STATE.md.bak-<stamp>
    that `git add -A` would then commit.

    LOOP 2 FIX (WP-B reproduced): render_state_md() returns its block WITH
    one trailing newline of its own (documented there; cmd_dashboard's own
    call to the prerendered-output funnel, passing render_state_md(root)
    with end="", relies on exactly that trailing newline and is untouched
    here). Splicing that block
    straight into pre + generated + post was not a fixed point: `post` is
    whatever already followed the END marker on disk, which on every render
    after the first already carries the PRIOR render's own trailing
    newline, so each re-render stacked one more blank line onto whatever
    followed the block, forever, whenever the file had anything (even just
    a lone trailing newline) after END. generated_block below carries NO
    trailing newline, the same convention tools/bm_project.py's own
    _splice_generated already uses (see its docstring for the identical
    bug, reproduced there first): the splice path leaves the file's true
    trailing bytes entirely to `post`, and both append paths add exactly
    one newline of their own instead of inheriting one from `generated`."""

    whole rendered document, human blocks included, and the redactor is a
    PATTERN scrubber, not a secret oracle: 'the DB password: ask Sam' comes back
    as 'the DB [REDACTED] Sam'. So a reviewer's paragraph was silently rewritten
    on the next regeneration, the CLI reported the block as preserved, the change
    was convergent (a later diff showed nothing), and there was no copy of the

    The human block is text a human typed into a file on disk. It never came out

    can decide.

    Everything OUTSIDE the markers, which is every line assembled from store
