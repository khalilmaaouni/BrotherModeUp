"""Regression tests for tools/bm_lint_walltime.py, the AST lint that refuses
the wall-clock stopwatch assertion pattern.
Standard library only. Run: python3 tools/test_bm_lint_walltime.py

WHAT THIS SUITE IS ACTUALLY DEFENDING
  The lint exists because seven people in ten days each fixed the same
  defect and review caught none of them before it shipped: a test asserting
  `assertLess(time.time() - started, 5.0)` measures the machine, not the
  code. A lint with false positives gets disabled by the first person it
  annoys, so this suite proves BOTH directions: every shape that must be
  caught, one test each, and every shape verified legitimate today that must
  NOT be caught, one test each, named so the shape is obvious from the test
  name alone. The last test runs the lint against this repository's own
  tools/ and scripts/ trees and demands the violation set equal exactly the
  one known instance, so calibration is proven on real code, not only on
  fixtures written to pass.

Every fixture is a tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(), never a real repo file.

    CHANGED 2026-08-10, and the reason matters more than the change. This

    for about an hour: the violation it pinned,
    test_a_missing_log_times_out_rather_than_raising in
    tools/test_brothermode_cli.py, was then fixed, and this test went red for
    the best possible reason, that the defect it described no longer exists.

    A test pinned to a known-bad line has to be rewritten every time somebody
    does the right thing, which trains people to edit the test rather than
    read it. So the assertion is now the invariant the project actually wants
    to hold forever: THE TREE IS CLEAN. It goes red when a violation is
    INTRODUCED, which is the direction that matters, and it never goes red
    because a violation was removed.

    The "must catch" half is not lost by this change. It is proven by the
