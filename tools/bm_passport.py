"""The change passport, producer half: what BrotherMode deposits at the seam.

WHAT THE SEAM IS. The change passport is the single crossing between
execution provenance and assurance (docs/specs/2026-08-15-change-passport-
seam.md in the BrotherSBE repository is the contract). BrotherMode produces
one, BrotherSBE consumes one, and it never travels back. This tool is the
producing end and the only place BrotherMode writes passport data.

THE TWO FIELDS THIS TOOL OWNS. Execution provenance owns exactly two of the
five fields the chain names, because only execution can see them:

  whoDidIt              the session and the claims it holds, plus the
                         accountable person by name (never a role)
  whereItCameFrom        the development method, named and not judged

A third field rides along because execution is also the only side that
knows what IT left undone, which assurance has no way to see:

  whatWasNotEstablished  gaps this producer itself hit while assembling the
                         deposit (a missing store, an unlabeled session, an
                         accountable person nobody named)

DIRECTION OF TRAVEL. This tool writes <root>/.sbe/passport.json and reads
NOTHING under .sbe/: no tasks.json, no evidence/, no existing passport.json.
Reaching across the seam to fill a field is the exact failure the seam
exists to prevent. Its only inputs are tools/bm_store.py's own store (read
only, never STATE.md, which is a generated view and not truth), `git config
user.name`, and the --accountable / --method flags.

A HOLLOW VALUE IS NOT A VALUE. An empty string, a whitespace-only string, an
empty list, or null all read as absence on the consuming side. A field this
tool cannot establish honestly is OMITTED from the deposit, never padded
with an empty placeholder to look filled, and the omission is explained on
stdout.

NOT A GATE. This tool reports and deposits, it never blocks on what it
FINDS: a store it could not read, a session nobody labeled and an
accountable person nobody named are all exit 0 with the gap written into
field 4, never a refusal. Three exits, stated exactly, because a tool whose
own documentation misreports its exit codes is the same overclaim this
product exists to catch:

  0  a deposit was written, whatever it could and could not establish
  1  the deposit itself could not be written to disk (the one case where
     running this tool and getting nothing is itself the finding)
  2  a usage error, or the NO-DATA verdict where no project root could be
     resolved at all, which is not a finding about a change but a failure
     to find a change to report on

Python floor is 3.9: no match statements, no `X | Y` annotations. Standard
library only, mirroring every other tool in this directory.

Run it with --help for the usage line, which resolves the command to the
layout the reader actually installed rather than naming a tools/ directory
a packaged install does not have.
