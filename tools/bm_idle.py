"""Detect whether this project's machine is at risk of doing nothing,
mechanically.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  On 2026-08-11 this project wrote an overnight plan with thirteen tasks.
  They all finished in ninety minutes. Nothing was queued behind them, so
  had the founder actually gone to bed, roughly six of eight hours would
  have produced nothing. His verdict: a plan whose completion leaves the
  machine idle is not finished being written. Depth is a deliverable, and
  running out of queue is a planning defect that must be REPORTED rather
  than quietly experienced. This tool is the mechanical detector for that
  defect. It answers one question: is this machine at risk of doing
  nothing?

THE CONTRACT
  Input is a queue file, default <root>/docs/plan/QUEUE.json, overridable
  with --queue PATH. Required top level keys: schema (integer), min_depth
  (integer), items (list). Optional: window (object with hard_stop ISO
  8601 and boolean unattended), idle_window_minutes (integer, default 30),
  watch_paths (list of paths relative to root, default ["tools", "docs"]).

  Each item has id, title, state. state is one of exactly queued,
  in_flight, done, blocked. Any other value makes the whole file unusable:
  verdict NO-DATA, exit 2, naming the offending id and value.

  DEPTH is the count of items in state queued. Items in state blocked
  NEVER count toward depth: a blocked item, by definition, cannot be
  started by anybody, so it cannot save a night no matter how many of them
  pile up. This is the load-bearing rule of the whole tool; see the
  comment at compute_counts() below for where it is enforced.

  Four verbs:
    depth   report the count, always exit 0 unless the file is unusable.
    next    the first queued item in array order.
    check   the gate verb; see check_queue() for its exact precedence.
    list    one line per item plus a summary.
  check is also the default when no verb is given.

  Exit codes are load bearing everywhere: 0 nothing wrong, 1 a real defect
  the founder needs to know about, 2 could not tell. NO-DATA output always
  starts with the literal string "NO-DATA:".

EFFECT CLASS: pure_read
  This tool writes NOT ONE BYTE anywhere, ever: no file writes, no
  directories created, no store touched, no "mark" verb. The reason is
  concrete: a tool that writes must be registered in this project's
  reviewed write-site inventory, and a pure reader does not. bm_store is
  loaded only to borrow its resolve_root() for --root resolution, and a
  writable bm_store.Store is never constructed (constructing one is itself
  a write: it probes the filesystem, edits git excludes, opens a WAL, and
  can migrate a schema).

BE SILENT-SAFE
  Any unexpected exception anywhere in this module is caught by `main` and
  reported as NO-DATA at exit 2, carrying the exception's type and
  message, rather than raising: a crashing check must never read as a
  pass.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No network. No subprocess.
No em or en dashes anywhere in this file or its output.

Usage:
  python3 tools/bm_idle.py depth [--queue PATH] [--root PATH]
  python3 tools/bm_idle.py next  [--queue PATH] [--root PATH]
  python3 tools/bm_idle.py check [--queue PATH] [--root PATH] [--now ISO]
  python3 tools/bm_idle.py list  [--queue PATH] [--root PATH]

`check` is also the default when no verb is given.
