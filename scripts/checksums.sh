# checksums.sh: a deterministic SHA256 manifest of every shipped file.
#
# Why this exists: docs/RELEASE.md explains the security problem it answers
# ("how do I know what I installed"). The install instruction clones a git
# branch or tag into a location whose code runs automatically on every
# Claude Code session (the hooks in ~/.claude/settings.json). This script is
# the maintainer-side half of the answer: it lists every file that ships in
# a release and its SHA256 hash, in a fixed order, so the same source tree
# always produces the same manifest byte for byte. verify-install.sh is the
# user-side half: it re-hashes an installed copy and compares against a
# manifest this script produced.
#
# POSIX sh only, no bashisms: no arrays, no [[ ]], no local, no process
# substitution, no here-strings. Every construct used here (command
# substitution, case, for/while with IFS, plain shell functions) is in
# POSIX.1-2017 section 2, and this has been run directly under both bash
# and dash to confirm neither rejects it.
#
# Usage, always from the repository root:
#   scripts/checksums.sh                    # print the manifest to stdout
#   scripts/checksums.sh CHECKSUMS.sha256   # write it to that file instead
#
# WHAT THE MANIFEST ATTESTS (finding 4B, 2026-07-27). A manifest line is
# "<sha256>  <path>", which on its own says nothing about what KIND of
# directory entry that path is. That gap was exploitable: `[ ! -f "$f" ]`
# follows symlinks, so a tracked symlink whose target happened to be a
# regular file sailed through the guard and hash_file then hashed the
# TARGET's bytes, producing a line indistinguishable from a real file while
# the actual shipped bytes (the link target string) went unattested.
# Reproduced: a git repo tracking a symlink as mode 120000 yielded a
# manifest entry whose hash was the hash of the link target's contents.
#
# The fix is to make the entry type part of what the manifest attests,
# rather than adding a per-entry type column that every existing published
# manifest would lack. This script now REFUSES to manifest anything that is
# not a regular file, so "every path in this manifest is a regular file" is
# an invariant of the format itself, established here at generation time and
# enforced by verify-install.sh at check time (it lstats each manifested
# path and fails if a regular file was swapped for a symlink). Refusing is
# chosen over recording the link target string on purpose: this project
# ships no symlinks (verified, every tracked entry is git mode 100644 or
# 100755), so a symlink appearing in a release tree is a defect or an
# attack, and a release is the right place to stop rather than to describe
# it. Classification is by lstat (`test -L` BEFORE `test -f`, because -L is
# the only test that sees the link itself and not what it points at) and,
# when git is available, by the tracked mode (120000 symlink, 160000
# submodule gitlink, 100644/100755 regular blob).
#
# "Shipped file" is defined as: every file git tracks in this repository at
# the commit being released. That is deliberate, not lazy: it is exactly
# the set of bytes a `git clone` (or `git checkout <tag>`) hands a user, so
# the manifest and the install are talking about the same tree by
# construction, and it can never drift from .gitignore because it does not
# reimplement .gitignore's rules. If this is ever run against a tree copied
# without its .git directory, it falls back to a plain filesystem walk with
# the same exclusions .gitignore already documents (STATE.md, CANVAS.md,
# threads/, __pycache__/, .DS_Store, *.bak*, .superpowers/) plus this repo's
# own machine state (.brothermode/). CANVAS.md joined that list on
# 2026-08-04: it is generated per machine by `bm_project.py start` and
# gitignored exactly like STATE.md, but only STATE.md was named here, so
# verify-install.sh reported CANVAS.md as an EXTRA file on every machine
# where anyone had ever started a project. A verifier that says FAILED on a
# correct installation trains people to ignore it, which costs more than the
# file was ever worth.

# GATE 5 (final-blockers spec 2026-07-26, VERIFIED BY ORCHESTRATOR): plain
# `git ls-files` quotes any tracked path containing a quote, a backslash, or
# a non-ASCII byte (git's default core.quotePath behavior), and the quoted
# form it prints is not a real path on disk. The old loop's `[ -f "$f" ]`
# check then failed for it and silently "continue"d past it, exit 0, no
# message: 91 tracked files in, 89 hashed, two dropped with nothing said.
# `-z` asks git for the exact bytes of every tracked path, NUL-terminated,
# never quoted, so every entry below is always the real, literal path.
# Residual, stated rather than hidden: a path containing a literal newline
# byte (legal on POSIX, vanishingly rare in practice, and not what this gate
# was about) would still be misread once `tr` turns NUL into newline; this
# closes the quoting defect the orchestrator reproduced, not every
# conceivable byte a filename could contain.
#
# FINDING 4B: `-s` is new and load-bearing. It makes git print the tracked
# mode alongside each path ("<mode> <object> <stage>\t<path>"), which is the
# only way to see that an entry is tracked AS a symlink (120000) or as a
# submodule gitlink (160000) rather than as a regular blob. Checking the
# tracked mode catches the entry type as the release records it; the lstat
# check in the hashing loop below independently catches the entry type as it
# exists on disk. Both run, because they answer different questions and an
# attacker only has to win one of them.
