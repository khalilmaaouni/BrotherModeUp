"""tools/bm_continue.py: the continuity adapter behind `brothermode
continue` (Phase C step 1 of the 2026-08-08 finalization plan, "The
continuity protocol").

WHY THIS EXISTS
  A session closed its loop on 2026-08-08, reported honestly, and
  stopped, leaving the founder to restart the program by hand the next
  morning. The founder's correction that evening was a product
  requirement, in their own words: "when you pass over to a new session
  do it seamlessly and automatically without my involvement as I might
  be sleeping or busy." A handover that depends on a session
  remembering to write one is a handover that fails on the night it
  matters, so the handover became a subcommand.

WHAT IT DOES
  Generates the HANDOFF PACKET from store rows, writes it through the
  same public document funnel every other generated view in this
  project uses (bs.write_generated_document), prints the exact command
  that starts the successor, and (unless --dry-run) starts it.

THE TEN SECTIONS
  Pinned by the founder on 2026-08-08 and pinned again as an ordered
  assertion in tools/test_brothermode_cli.py, because a packet that
  quietly drops section 9 is a packet that loses a founder decision:

    1. North star and goals            projects row (goal, user
                                       outcome, success criteria)
    2. Where we stand, one paragraph   project status and phase, task
                                       counts by state, newest
                                       sentinel status
    3. Read next, in this order        the generated documents, plus
                                       every recorded view with its
                                       published artifact url
    4. Next actions, ordered           active and ready tasks, by
                                       priority
    5. Evidence index                  evidence rows, per task
    6. Telemetry                       spend totals against the
                                       contract ceilings, newest
                                       forecast
    7. Lessons learnt                  active procedural memories
    8. Features pipeline               tasks not yet ready
    9. Open founder decisions          unsuperseded key decisions,
                                       unanswered interruptions,
                                       unresolved human steps
   10. The continuity contract         what the successor owes the
                                       program, plus its own launch
                                       command

  Every one of them is built from ROWS. Nothing here narrates a fact the
  store does not hold: a section with no rows says so plainly rather
  than inventing filler, which is the difference between a generated
  view and a report that reads well and means nothing.

WHY THE PACKET IS A WHOLE-FILE RENDER
  tools/bm_project.py's CANVAS.md and DELIVERY-PACKET.md splice a
  generated block between markers so a human's own prose around them
  survives. This packet does not: it is written for a SUCCESSOR SESSION
  that must be able to trust every line as current, and a hand-edited
  paragraph sitting inside it, indistinguishable from generated text,
  is exactly the stale instruction that gets a successor to do the
  wrong thing at three in the morning. So the whole file is generated,
  it says so on its first line, and anything a human wants the
  successor to know goes into the store, where the next regeneration
  will carry it.

BYTE-STABLE BY CONSTRUCTION
  No render timestamp anywhere: two runs over the same rows produce the
  same bytes, the same law tools/bm_project.py's render_canvas states
  and tools/test_brothermode_cli.py pins here too. The packet's dates
  are the rows' own dates.

THE ONE ROOT CAUSE THIS FILE ENCODES AS CODE
  `claude --add-dir` is VARIADIC, so a prompt written after it is
  swallowed as another directory and the session dies with "Input must
  be provided either through stdin or as a prompt argument when using
  --print". That killed the first relay launch of 2026-08-08. In
  launch_argv below the prompt is argv[2], immediately after -p, before
  any other flag, and a test pins that position rather than trusting
  anyone to remember it.

SUCCESSOR LIVENESS (Phase C step 3, added 2026-08-08)
  A spawn is not a handover. On 2026-08-08 the first relay was started,
  died in the same second on a prompt that `--add-dir` had swallowed,
  and was reported as launched; the program then sat still until the
  founder restarted it by hand. So the launch now WATCHES: it waits a
  bounded time for the successor's first line of output, asks the
  operating system whether the process is still there, and writes both
  into the store as ONE evidence row against the project
  (kind="successor-liveness"). Three verdicts, one exit code each:

    SPOKE    output arrived. Exit 0.
    RUNNING  nothing yet, process still there. Exit 0.
    GONE     nothing, and the process has exited. Exit 1.

  RUNNING is not a hedge, and the live canary is why it exists: `claude
  -p` buffers its ENTIRE turn and flushes at the end, so a healthy
  headless successor sits on a zero-byte log for minutes (process 33718,
  alive and silent at 43 seconds, 2026-08-08). The first draft of this
  step treated silence as death and would have failed every real
  handover. What actually distinguishes the disaster it was written for
  is that the PROCESS WAS GONE.

  What is mechanical and what is not, stated plainly: the row proves a
  process existed and, on SPOKE, that it said a word. It does not prove
  the successor understood its brief. Nothing here can prove that, no
  wording in this file pretends otherwise, and a test pins the absence of
  that claim.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO
  It never types a credential, never publishes anything, and never
  tags: those stay founder-gated whatever a successor is told to do.
  The one line of successor output it stores goes through the same
  secret redactor every generated view uses (bs.redact_text), because a
  successor's first line is text this file did not write.

Python 3.9, standard library only. No em or en dashes anywhere in this
file, its comments, or its output.

# The relay brake (2026-08-09). Three mechanical stops in front of the spawn.
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG, so the reason survives longer than the memory of it
#   CONTRACT_LINES item 4 above tells every successor to launch its own
#   successor before it closes. Written as prose, it is unconditional: it
#   names no budget, no depth, no end time. On 2026-08-08 the chain ran
#   while the founder was away from the machine. Forty sessions in this
#   project alone logged 6,331 turns between 00:00Z and 10:00Z, roughly
#   6.4 million output tokens and 1.69 billion cache-read tokens, with
#   fifteen live at once against a declared cap of nine. Three of them died
#   holding uncommitted work that had to be replayed onto main by hand
#   (commit e7dcd01).
#
#   The bitter part is that the ceiling already existed. The signed
#   contract carried token_ceiling = 3,000,000 and tools/bm_controller.py
#   compares spend against it correctly. It never fired because the meter
#   was empty: autonomy_spend held ZERO rows for the whole window, so the
#   breaker compared 0 against 3,000,000 forever, and in any case its
#   authority reaches only units it dispatched itself, which was two. Every
#   other session was outside any contract by construction.
#
#   So this brake deliberately does NOT depend on the meter. It depends on
#   two facts a relay always knows about itself, its own depth and the
#   clock, and it consults spend only as a third, additional stop. A
#   control that needs a working meter is a control that fails exactly when
#   the meter is what broke.
#
# WHY A REFUSAL EXITS 0
#   Refusing to continue is the tool doing its job, not failing at it. The
#   packet is still written and the launch line is still printed, so a
#   founder loses no handover and can run the command by hand after reading
#   why the chain stopped. What the refusal removes is the machine's
#   ability to continue ITSELF, unattended, without anyone deciding to.
